1,812,Hocus Pocus,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,4.5,"Our take on a classic summer ale.  A toast to weeds, rays, and summer haze.  A light, crisp ale for mowing lawns, hitting lazy fly balls, and communing with nature, Hocus Pocus is offered up as a summer sacrifice to clodless days.

Its malty sweetness finishes tart and crisp and is best apprediated with a wedge of orange."
27,878,Full Moon Winter Ale,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,5.599999905,This full-bodied ale is brewed with roasted malts and a hint of Dark Belgian sugar for a perfectly balanced taste.
28,935,Odell IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,7,"We took the traditional IPA, originally shipped from England to India in the 1700's, and made it bolder and more flavorful - American Style. We've added new varieties of highly aromatic American hops to create a distinctive bitterness profile and an incredible hop character."
29,1271,Ornery Amber Lager,8,95,American-Style Lager,0,Ornery Amber is brewed with a blend of the finest European hops and gently roasted malts.
30,935,Cutthroat Porter,2,25,Porter,4.800000191,"Not quite a stout but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust. Inspired by the classic London porters, we use dark roasted malts to create a deep, rich color and flavor that hint at chocolate and coffee. We named it Cutthroat Porter as our tribute to the Colorado state fish - with its own rich heritage and unmistakable dark coloring. And while we're big fans of small batches, here's to the currently threatened Cutthroat population reaching mass quantities."
31,1271,Maple Nut Brown Ale Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,0,Maple syrup is added to each barrel of Maple Nut Brown Ale to impart roasted sweetness balancing the nut flavor produced by chocolate malts.
40,1307,Quelque Chose,5,70,Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic,8,"Quelque Chose was launched in January 1996. This versatile beer was specifically developed as a winter beer because, when warmed to 70 C (160 F), it can be taken as a hot drink. On the other hand, on the rocks, it is a wonderful aperitif. The cherries are soaked for months in slightly bitter ale before being blended into the beer. Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts."
43,723,Maracaibo Especial,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,7.5,"A rich brown ale inspired by the enigmatic monastic brews of Belgium, and the mysterious mist shrouded jungles of the tropics. Brewed with real cacao, and spiced with cinnamon and sweet orange peel for a sensual delight. A brew to be sipped, savored, and enjoyed!"
45,723,Calabaza Blanca,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,4.800000191,"Aged in large oak casks and refermented in the bottle, Calabaza Blanca is a Belgian Biere Blanche. Spiced with orange peel and corriander, you'll find it refreshingly tart, with a wonderfully dry finish."
58,1221,Furious Beer,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6,"Like Hops? You'll like this fire-hued beer. This is the beer I have always dreamed of making. This is the beer that would come to mind while spending the last two years tearing down walls, hanging sheetrock, moving kegs, power washing the ceilings, arguing with various agencies, and cutting the water main. 

Without Golden Promise malt, made by family-owned Simpsons Malt, Furious would just be pissed off-ed. From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end. Oh yeah, it's about 6% alcohol and around 100 IBUs."
59,1221,Bender Beer,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,5.099999905,"This beer is an amalgamation of styles; brown/porter/apa. Five distinct malts, including two from Belgium, give this beer added complexity and depth. We also add oatmeal to this beer to give it a smooth texture not usually associated with this type of beer. We add large amounts of American finishing hops to give Bender a citrus hop aroma because... we like hops. This is a session beer weighing in around 5% alcohol and 25 IBUs. Grab one today, we think you will want another!"
63,935,Isolation Ale,11,141,Winter Warmer,6,"Ever been in a warm, cozy cabin and had a secret desire to get snowed in?

69,923,God Jul - Winter Ale,3,42,American-Style Stout,8.5,"A dark ale brewed specially for the Christmas season, with a rich, complex taste of caramel. This is a strong, dark and rather sweet Christmas Beer -  just the way we think a Christmas beer should be."
71,161,Nut Cracker Ale,11,141,Winter Warmer,5.900000095,"Nutcracker Ale is Boulevard's holiday gift for real beer lovers. This hearty, warming brew is a classic winter ale, deep amber in color, with hints of molasses balanced by the 'spiciness' of freshly harvested Chinook hops."
80,1202,Weizengold Hefefein,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,5.099999905,"Stiegl Weizengold. It has 12o original gravity; the choicest ingredients and a top fermentation process are responsible for the highest possible quality and an unmistakable flavor. It is brewed according to the classic wheat beer recipe: 60 % wheat malt and 40 % barley malt, top fermentation and in compliance with the Purity Law of 1516.  This fine yeast wheat beer specialty is a refreshing, natural and stimulating beer brand."
103,1260,Robert the Bruce Scottish Ale,1,15,Scotch Ale,7,"A big malty body from chocolate and roasted malts, well balanced with just the right combination of hops. Robust yet smooth, a true malt-lover's delight."
124,441,Buzzsaw Brown,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,4.800000191,"By 1915, Bend, Oregon, was alive with the sound of the buzz saw, as two of the country's largest pine sawmills set up shop on the banks of the Deschutes River.  The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. 

Buzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard day's work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.

'Buzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,' says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. 'The unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.'"
126,584,Geist Bock,7,90,Traditional German-Style Bock,6.099999905,"This is one of our rare lagers brewed in the style of the German Heiliges Geist Bock, or Holy Ghost Bock. The name refers to the lighter nature of the beer as opposed to the darker and heavier Doppel Bock and Mai Bock also brewed during the spring in Germany. There is a rich malt flavor, a firm German style lager head, and a clean lagered finish to this beer.  Available on draft or in 12 oz. bottles."
128,397,Dark Ale,1,10,English-Style Pale Mild Ale,4.5,"A dark brew full of promise. Coopers Dark Ale is a journey in taste, starting fresh and creamy, and finishing with a lingering coffee flavour. 

Conditioned and naturally brewed using the top fermentation method, Coopers 'Dark' is made using roasted and chocolate malts, giving it a rich dark colour and unique flavour. 

Coopers Dark Ale has no additives and no preservatives."
129,441,Cinder Cone Red,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,5.400000095,"Cinder Cone Red's diverse selection of hops and barley captivates thirsty palates with its toffee-like flavor, intense citrus aroma and defined bitterness.

Located on the northern slope of Mt. Bachelor, the Cinder Cone was also known as ""Red Hill"" due to its reddish color that is revealed as the seasons change, the weather warms and the snow melts.  It's spring. Time to get outside."
138,935,Odell Red Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,6.5,"The Rocky Mountain Goat is no ordinary goat. Just like Odell Red is no ordinary red. 

We took the American-style red to a whole new level by adding a variety of aggressive American hops-giving this ale a distinctive fresh hop aroma and flavor. 

We think you'll agree this red has some serious kick."
157,723,Biere de Mars,1,13,Old Ale,7,A sustaining beer that is brewed to comfort in the gusty ides of March and welcome in a wealth of warmer weather.
177,723,Luciernaga,5,64,Belgian-Style Pale Ale,6.5,"An artisan pale ale brewed in the Grand Cru tradition. Enjoy its golden effervescence and gentle hop aroma. Coriander and Grains of Paradise round out the spicy palate, melting o so softly into a silken finish of hoppiness and bliss! Make any season a celebration!"
179,859,Beer Geek Breakfast,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,7.5,"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, many say, and if you are a beer geek there is no better way to start the day than with a powerful, complex morning stout. The unique mix of oats and coffee gives this beer large body and power, while the coffee, at the same time, creates a nice balance."
188,481,Certified Organic Amber Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,4.800000191,"Eel River Brewing Company, brewers of California's first Certified Organic Ale, proudly brings you our Organic Amber Ale.

208,935,90 Shilling,1,7,Scottish-Style Light Ale,5.300000191,"We introduced 90 Shilling, our flagship beer, at our opening party in 1989. For a while, we'd been wondering - what would happen if we lightened up the traditional Scottish ale? The result is an irresistibly smooth and delicious medium-bodied amber ale. The name 90 Shilling comes from the Scottish method of taxing beer. Only the highest quality beers were taxed 90 Shillings. A shilling was a British coin used from 1549 to 1982. We think you'll find this original ale brilliantly refreshing, and worth every shilling."
209,905,Sunshine Wheat,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,4.800000191,"SUNSHINE WHEAT is a great beer for trouncing thirst.  Yet, it has a depth of character that inspires a quiet moment's reflection. Sunshine Wheat swirls in the mouth with ripples of coriander and orange peel tartness, settling nicely into a tranquil sea of apple and honey tones.  A filtered wheat beer, Sunshine offers a crisp, refreshing alternative to heavier-bodied heffe-weizens."
214,161,Lunar Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,5.099999905,"Our first new year-round brand launch since 1996, Lunar Ale is in a category all its own. Brewed using a unique aromatic yeast, this refreshing variety is best described as a cloudy brown ale with a complex, malty aroma and flavor, and a crisp, dry finish."
215,604,Denver Pale Ale / DPA,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5.400000095,"Historically Great Divide's flagship beer, DPA's record speaks for itself. By continually garnering national and international recognition, DPA has risen to become one of the most award-winning English-style pale ales in the world.

Sporting a brilliant copper hue and an assertive floral hop aroma, DPA is known for its smooth, malty middle, which is expertly complemented with hearty and complex hop flavor. DPA's extraordinary hop finish is marked by crisp yet moderate hop bitterness. Its well-balanced profile makes DPA the perfect beer to accompany a hearty mountain picnic or a night on the town. For those who seek beers characterized by excitement, flavor and distinction, Denver Pale Ale is the natural choice."
221,296,Pater 6,5,60,Belgian-Style Dubbel,6.699999809,"This name became a reference. This beer is mostly pointed out with its product name: 'a Paterke'. 

This 'Paterke' is a chestnut coloured dark beer with a high fermentation (6.7 alcohol content) and a full taste."
223,905,Skinny Dip,3,37,Golden or Blonde Ale,4.199999809,"Ever tried a Skinny Dip? You wouldn't be alone. Featured by both Men's Journal and the Today Show as a favorite summer brew, this full-bodied, highly drinkable beer makes a splash every summer in our Seasonal line-up. Cascade hops frolic with a hint of lime leaf, giving the beer complexity that's surprisingly refreshing."
247,604,Hot Shot ESB,1,5,Extra Special Bitter,5,"HotShot ESB is an easy-drinking and remarkably smooth Extra Special Bitter, brewed in the classic-English style. More assertively hopped than ordinary bitters, light copper-colored HotShot showcases clean hop flavors, balanced by its slightly fruity nose and light-caramel malt character.

While HotShot is one of Great Divide's easiest-drinking and lower alcohol beers, its complex flavor profile makes it the perfect session beer for craft beer lovers."
249,923,Nogne o Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,9,"We think the russian tsar would have liked his stout this way. A dark, rich ale in which a generous sweetness with roasted malt bitterness.  Serving temp.10 C/50 F. Great with vanilla ice cream or dark chocolate."
250,923,Nogne o Porter,2,25,Porter,7,"In this quite dark ale, dark malts provide flavors of coffee and dried fruit. Recommended serving temperature 10 C/50 F.  Try with dark chocolate, cheese, or red meat dishes."
251,923,Nogne o Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,6,A refreshing light and hoppy ale. Probably our best allrounder.  Recommended serving temperature 8 C/45 F.  Ideal with barbequed or smoked meat dishes.
288,385,Yule Tide,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,10,"The latest addition to Baltimore's own Clipper City Brewing Company - Mutiny Fleet is their holiday brew Yule Tide, a Belgian style triple ale, which like the rest of the Mutiny Fleet is distributed in 22 ounce bombers."
290,308,Warka Strong,8,95,American-Style Lager,7,European Strong Lager
335,935,Levity Amber Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,5.099999905,"Levity is our lighter take on the amber ale. Munich and honey malts give it a full-bodied flavor and a happy-go-lucky personality. Then we let the finishing hops shine, for a beer that's crisp instead of bitter, as many ambers are. Levity was named by our brewers partly for its light color - and partly for the way it just refuses to take itself too seriously. Hey, we could all use a little levity once in a while."
336,935,Easy Street Wheat,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,4.599999905,"Light and refreshing, Easy Street Wheat is an unfiltered American-style wheat beer. Leaving in the yeast gives the beer a nice, smooth finish and a slightly citrusy flavor. Easy Street Wheat gets its name by brewers ""taking it easy"" and not filtering the beer. However, for ultimate enjoyment, we encourage you to work just a little harder in pouring it: just pour 2/3 of the beer into a glass, swirl what's left to stir up the yeast, then pour the rest and enjoy."
337,161,Boulevard Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5.400000095,"Boulevard Pale Ale is a smooth, fruity, well-balanced beer with year-round appeal. A variety of caramel malts impart a rich flavor and amber color, while liberal use of whole hops adds zest and aroma. Pale Ale is the first beer we brewed, and continues to be a perennial favorite."
338,161,Bully! Porter,2,25,Porter,5.400000095,"The intense flavors of dark-roasted malt in Boulevard's rendition of the classic English porter are perfectly balanced by a generous and complex hop character. Bully! Porter's robust nature makes it the ideal companion to a variety of foods, from seafood to chocolate."
345,161,Boulevard Dry Stout,3,42,American-Style Stout,4.900000095,"Velvety black and perfectly opaque, our bottled Dry Stout is the somewhat livelier companion to our popular draught version of this enduring style. This surprisingly smooth, drinkable beer is a delightful harmony of smoky roasted flavors and tangy, coffee-like notes."
350,272,Arabier,5,65,Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale,9,"An arabier is a pure malt beer 8 vol/alc brewed with flower Nugget-hops from Poperinge. It has the special dry-hopping taste and aroma, so appreciated by beer lovers all over the world. It is one of the two main beers from De Dolle Brouwers throughout the year. Aging time is limited due to the fact that hop bitterness is declining with the time. Store arabier cool and dark and serve cool at 10 C. Cheers!"
360,7,Rochefort 10,5,62,Belgian-Style Quadrupel,11.30000019,"Reddish-brown colour, with a very compact head and an aroma of figs, feels like honey in the mouth. The alcohol profile is a major component in the flavour of this rich ale. It is very similar to 6 and 8, but has much more of everything. Some may find the high alcohol content to be disagreeable."
361,167,McChouffe,3,29,Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale,8.5,"Description : Dark Ale, strong, spicy, lightly hoppy, with evoluting taste. Natural Beer, bottle refermented, unfiltered, not pasteurised and without any additives

Original gravity : 16  Plato

Storage : Store the bottles vertically in a cold place, sheltered from light. The yeast deposit can either be drunk or left according to taste

371,296,Watou Tripel,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,7.5,The flavour of this beer is pleasantly soft and is characterized by a delicate bitterness where the balance between malt and hop is based upon a fruity orange taste with a straight fresh after taste (7.5% alcohol content)
377,1115,Doppelbock Dunkel,7,92,German-Style Doppelbock,8.5,"DoppelBock Dunkel has a pleasant full and creamy body, with a cofeeish aroma. Nicely warming with toffeelike malty sweetness, balanced by a hoppy-bitterness in the finish."
395,723,Bam Biere,5,74,French & Belgian-Style Saison,4.5,"An artisan farmhouse ale that is golden, naturally cloudy, bottle conditioned and dry hopped for a perfectly refreshing balance of spicy malts, hops and yeast."
397,609,Barleywine,3,35,American-Style Barley Wine Ale,10,"Our American-style Barleywine undergoes a three hour boil to intensify the caramel malts and the enormous Pacific Northwest hop charge. The result is a rich, estery brew with toffee notes and citrus hop flavors layered throughout. Enjoy this brew fresh today or lay it down for aging to see how the flavors of each vintage evolve."
400,1023,Aventinus Weizenstarkbier / Doppel Weizen Bock,4,55,South German-Style Weizenbock,8.199999809,"Dark-ruby, almost black-colored and streaked with fine top-fermenting yeast, this beer has a compact and persistent head. This is a very intense wheat doppelbock with a complex spicy chocolate-like arome with a hint of banana and raisins. On the palate, you experience a soft touch and on the tongue it is very rich and complex, though fresh with a hint of caramel. It finishes in a rich soft and lightly bitter impression."
401,905,New Belgium Trippel Belgian Style Ale,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,8.5,"Our Trippel Belgian Style Ale (pronounced triple) opens with a bold blast of hops that slowly gives way to the fruity esters implied by our Belgian yeast strain. The Three Graces hand-painted on the label are Zeus's daughters Aglaia (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (good cheer). In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation. Remarkably smooth and complex, our bottle-conditioned Trippel is spiced with a trace of coriander."
403,905,Abbey Belgian Style Ale,5,60,Belgian-Style Dubbel,7,"Winner of four World Beer Cup medals and eight medals at the Great American Beer Fest, Abbey Belgian Ale is the Mark Spitz of New Belgium's lineup - but it didn't start out that way. When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeff's first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert."
406,1054,Iron Fist Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,0,An amber pale ale dry hopped with a blend of American hops.
408,723,Oro de Calabaza,5,65,Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale,8,Brewed in the Franco-Belgian tradition of strong golden ales.  Spicy and peppery with a gentle hop bouquet and the beguiling influence of wild yeast.
409,723,La Roja,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,7.199999809,"An artisan amber ale brewed in the Flanders tradition.  Deep amber with earthy caramel, spice, and sour fruit notes developed through natural barrel aging.  Unfiltered, unpasteurized and blended from barrels ranging in age from two to ten months."
411,441,Hop Trip Fresh Hop Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5.5,"This Fresh Hop Pale Ale is all about celebrating the hop harvest in the fall.  Fresh picked hops have to be added to the brew immediately and in abundance.  Roughly 270 pounds of Crystal hops from Doug Weathers' farm outside Salem, Oregon will be added to the 50 barrel batch in addition to some dry kilned whole flower hops.  That adds up to approximately 5.5 pounds of hops per barrel brewed.  Another deliciously interesting beer in our Bond Street Series."
414,604,Hibernation Ale,1,13,Old Ale,8.100000381,"Great Divide's award-winning Hibernation Ale is Colorado's original strong ale -  it has been our winter seasonal each year since 1995. Since that time, Hibernation has become the most sought-after winter beer in Colorado. Hibernation's massive flavors are so intense that it requires over three months of aging each year. Each summer, while our brewers are still spending their weekends in flip-flops and shorts, they prepare for July's Hibernation brewing schedule.

We cellar Hibernation until late October, when it reaches the peak of perfection. This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.  Hibernation Ale is the perfect gift or accompaniment to your winter festivities."
416,905,2  Below,1,5,Extra Special Bitter,6.599999905,"Pull on your wool socks and crack open a 2  Below Ale. This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill -  a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800's. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2  Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow."
419,604,Hercules Double IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,9.100000381,"Hoppier, maltier and with more alcohol than a standard IPA, Hercules Double IPA definitely is not for the faint of heart. Hercules Double IPA is, however, an elixir fit for the gods. A brash but creamy wonder, Hercules pours a deep orange-coppery color, forming substantial lace in the glass. Hercules Double IPA delivers a huge amount of piney, floral, and citrusy hop aroma and flavor from start to finish. A hefty backbone of nutty, toffee-like malt character balances Hercules' aggressive, punchy hop profile."
420,604,Fresh Hop Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,6.099999905,"The September hop harvest is a once-a-year opportunity to brew with fresh hops, also called 'wet hops.' Given the perishable nature of just-harvested hop cones, they are shipped overnight to Great Divide shortly after harvest. The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver, Great Divide's brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered.

Using fresh hops is a big endeavor, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma. Fresh Hop is a superbly refreshing, medium bodied, light-copper colored pale ale."
423,441,Inversion IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.800000191,"After several months of experimentation, energy and obsession, Deschutes Brewery's brewers have triumphed once again.  Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutes' brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. 

Just like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.  Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday."
431,905,Blue Paddle Pilsener,7,77,German-Style Pilsener,4.800000191,"Climb on in and grab a paddle. Our first foray into lagered beers, Blue Paddle Pilsener-Lager, is a Czech style pilsener with a refreshing crispness from noble hops and a rich, malty finish. 'Blue Paddle' refers to the implement our warehouse manager's Grandma once used to lovingly paddle his a** when she caught him stealing sips of her beer. With more body than a traditional Belgian pils, Blue Paddle is reflective of Europe's finest pilseners."
440,296,Abt 12,5,62,Belgian-Style Quadrupel,10,"The absolute top quality in the hierarchy of the St. Bernardus beers. It is also the beer with the highest alcohol content (10.50 %).
A dark ivory coloured beer with a high fermentation. 

The show piece of the brewery. Thanks to its soft and unconditionally genuine aroma, the beer can be smoothly tasted.  The Abt has a very fruity flavour."
475,296,Prior 8,5,60,Belgian-Style Dubbel,8,"This noble delicious beer with a high fermentation has a ruby purple colour with a full malty and fruity taste (8% alcohol content). 

This beer has a beautiful round froth due to the second fermentation with a taste that creates a perfect balance between sweet and sour."
480,757,Monchshof Premium Schwarzbier,7,86,German-Style Schwarzbier,4.900000095,"Schwarzbier means ""black beer"" in German. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a ""black Pils,"" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.

In a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass."
481,296,St. Bernardus Tripel,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,8,"This beer, with high fermentation, has a pale amber colour and a flowery, fruity taste with a harmonious balance between sweet and sour (8% alcohol content). 
This beer has a thick and vivid froth and strikes by its balanced taste with a delicate bitterness."
485,7,Rochefort 6,3,29,Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale,7.5,"eddish colour, almost like autumn leaves, very consistent texture with a slightly spicy aroma and an intense taste of caramel, fruit, and hints of raisins. It is only brewed about once per year, representing approximately 1% of total beer production, thus is quite difficult to obtain."
487,262,Westmalle Trappist Tripel,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,9.5,"Was first brewed in 1934 and the recipe has not changed since 1956. It is made with pale candy sugar and has a very pale color produced from a mash of light pilsener malts.

In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel."

dryness."

2447,68,Big Eye IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6,"ndia Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.

British troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.

American home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.

Big Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head."

Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn't end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness."

These particular lemons added the perfect balance of citrus tartness and sweetness to accent the taste of the beer.

It then joins another 20% Barrel Aged Old Viscosity (from a previous batch) that has been aging in bourbon barrels.

3912,6,6,3,37,Golden or Blonde Ale,6,"Blonde Ales are one of the fastest growing beer styles in Belgium, France and the UK. Moorgat's Maredsous 6 is an easy drinking Blonde with a balance of graininess and aromatic hop."
3913,526,10 Squared (10),3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,10,"The Mighty Fish Brewers first produced Ten Squared Anniversary Ale to celebrate Fish Brewing Company's tenth anniversary. The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs. Ten different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed. 

Even with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey. Produced for the holidays, 10 102 Anniversary Ale is usually available into late spring."
3914,157,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,8,95,American-Style Lager,4.75,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager is the best example of the fundamental characteristics of a great beer, offering a full, rich flavor that is both balanced and complex. It is brewed using a decoction mash, a time consuming, traditional four vessel brewing process discarded by many contemporary brewers. This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston Lager also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops."
3915,157,Samuel Adams Double Bock,7,90,Traditional German-Style Bock,8.800000191,"Intense and warming, a meal in a bottle.
One can not help but appreciate Samuel Adams Double Bock's huge malt character. We use an enormous amount of malt, half a pound per bottle, to brew this intensely rich lager. Its deep brown-ruby color is all made in the kettle - no black malt is used, resulting in a rich sweetness that is free of the rough taste of burnt malt. All that remains is the velvet smooth flavor and mouthfeel of the two row malt. Samuel Adams Double Bock's intense malt character is balanced with a subtle piney, citrus hop note from the German Noble hops.

Due to legal restrictions, Samuel Adams Double Bock can not be sold in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia."
3916,157,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,5.199999809,"right and citrusy, brewed with mysterious grains of paradise.
Samuel Adams Summer Ale is an American wheat ale. This summer seasonal uses malted wheat as well as lemon zest and grains of paradise, a rare pepper from Africa first used as a brewing spice in the 13th Century to create a crisp and spicy flavor and body. The ale fermentation imparts a background tropical fruit note reminiscent of mangos and peaches. All of these come together to create a quenching, clean finishing beer perfect for those warm Summer days"
3917,157,Samuel Adams Boston Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,4.940000057,"A smooth, refined version of a classic ale.
Samuel Adams Boston Ale was first brewed to celebrate the opening of our Boston Brewery. Like Samuel Adams Boston Lager, it was an old family recipe that was rescued by Jim Koch from his father's attic. Samuel Adams Boston Ale, a Stock Ale, has a complex, caramel malt character balanced with distinct spicy and herbal hop notes. Our proprietary ale yeast imparts a variety of fruit and ester notes in both the nose and flavor which are indicative of the style."
3918,157,Samuel Adams Black Lager,7,86,German-Style Schwarzbier,4.900000095,"When one sees a beer with a darker complexion these days, more often than not it"
3919,157,Samuel Adams Winter Lager,7,90,Traditional German-Style Bock,5.800000191,"Bold and rich, with a touch of holiday spice
The first thing one notices in a Samuel Adams Winter Lager is its color: the deep brown of winter. Then comes the magical aroma which promises something special on the tongue. The warm aroma of cinnamon and ginger which blends with the roasty sweetness of the malted barley and hint of citrus from the orange peel. And after that first sip the promise is fulfilled. On the palate Samuel Adams Winter Lager is rich and full bodied, robust and warming, a wonderful way to enjoy the cold evenings that come with this season."
3920,1352,Merry Monks,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,9.300000191,"Merry Monks' Ale is a Belgian style Abby Trippel without limitation.  This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.

When you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.

You might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink."
3921,1352,Winter Ale,11,141,Winter Warmer,5.599999905,"At Weyerbacher we've created a Winter Ale that is a must for any malty beer lover. Winner of a Silver Medal in the 1998 World Beer Championships, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is brewed with deep-roasted chocolate malt. The taste predominates with a warm, roasty flavor, balanced out with a slightly dry finish. It's smooth but not cloying, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV).

Although winter ales predate history, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.

Generally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night."
3922,1352,AutumnFest,7,84,German-Style Oktoberfest,5.400000095,"AutumnFest is Weyerbacher's own unique twist on the German Oktoberfest style. Copper-amber in color, AutumnFest is made with Vienna and Munich malts for that authentic, Bavarian easy drinking taste.  Each sip imparts a wonderful roastiness of malt on the tongue followed by a smooth, consistent finish.  Wonderfully balanced with a clean, velvety, slightly fruity taste, AutumnFest is the perfect beer for the Fall- a nice transition between the lighter beers of summer and the darker, heavier winter brews. It's a favorite of many Weyerbacher aficionados, who anticipate the end of summer with this wonderful beer. 

   Weyerbacher AutumnFest ( ABV 5.4%) is generally available in stores August through December.  Pick up a case to celebrate the change of seasons. Prost!"
3923,1352,Black Hole,2,25,Porter,7,"Coming in at an ABV of 7.0%, Our Black Hole satisfies the transition from dark ale to stout. We think of this as slightly ""Porter-ish"" with a strong malt body and a very light hop finish. This is brewed year round and is available in Pennsylvania in the regular Variety Pack.  This will help the ale drinker among us maintain their own balance!"
3924,1352,Blanche,5,67,Belgian-Style White,5,"Clean, refreshing and perhaps just a bit tart, our brewers developed Weyerbacher Blanche just after their trip to Belgium during the winter of 2000.  Blanche, meaning ""white"", takes its name from the whitish haze in this pale gold brew, which is a result of the raw wheat and wheat malts used to brew this Belgian-style beer. 

In 2002, Blanche was named as Best of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast in the Belgian Specialty category at the US Beer Tasting Championships.

White beers are well known as the principal product from Hoegaarden, a small town in a wheat-growing region east of Brussels.  Light, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with microbrewed quality and freshness.

Blanche is a thirst quenching beer that combines character and flavor with a moderate alcohol content.  Just try a bottle.  In the nose you'll notice spiciness from the coriander seeds and dried curacao orange peels added during the boil.  In the mouth you'll find a mild and refreshing ale with a hint of dryness from the wheat ingredients.  A clean finish follows with just a hint of tart spiciness."
3925,1352,Blasphemy,5,62,Belgian-Style Quadrupel,11.80000019,"First released in March 2007,  Blasphemy is our award winning QUAD aged in bourbon barrels.  But not overaged, so we've picked up gentle vanilla oaky notes which complement rather than supercede the complex qualities that already make QUAD such an incredible beer.  Expected to be an annual Spring seasonal, supplies are limited.  ABV is 11.8%."
3926,1352,Blithering Idiot,3,35,American-Style Barley Wine Ale,11.10000038,"At Weyerbacher, we prefer to brew things true to European style guidelines. Consequently our barley wine is  on the malty side, yet not  overly sweet. Notes of date or perhaps fig on the palate follow a pleasurably malty aroma to your taste buds. The finish is warm and fruity, and begs for the next sip.

Enjoy Blithering Idiot in a brandy snifter or wine glass, preferably in front of the fire, or accompanying a literary classic. This is the finest life has to offer and should be treated as such. Moments of reflection make all the toil worthwhile, and Blithering Idiot is for moments like these. Share it with your family over the holiday dinner. Lay a few down, aging only helps a barley wine develop more class. At 11.1 % ABV (alcohol by volume) this fine ale will keep for years. Our expected maximum shelf-life is 2 to 3 years. Although it might see a decade, beyond the 3rd year most barley-wines have a tendency to decrease in complexity, so don't wait too long"
3927,1352,Decadence,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,13,"Decadence is our Tenth Anniversay spiced amber ale.  This is a very limited production, brewed only once, to celebrate ten fantastic years in business.  This ale weighs in at 13% ABV and is a fantastic sipper, especially after dinner or consider paring it with a good book on a cool fall evening.  Decadence is brewed with honey, cardamom spice and gentian (a rare botanical!)  This ale is very unique and will develop finer character when aged at cellar temperatures."
3928,1333,Oatmeal Stout,1,21,Oatmeal Stout,5.5,Pours a very deep black with a pleasant aroma and a thick brown head.  It has the usual coffee taste you would expect with a hint of chocolate.  There is quite a lot of carbonation but is very drinkable.
3929,1352,Double Simcoe IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,9,"Double Simcoe IPA, 9.0% abv, is our incredible reward for Hopheads seeking over the top flavor in a Double IPA, without the harshness. Brewed  with Simcoe hops, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC, in the year 2000. This hybrid hops was created to allow maximum aromatic oils, along with low cohumulone(harshness) levels, so that brewers can really load up a lot of 'em in a beer and not have any harshness. The piney, citrusy notes are all here, and in a very clean (non-harsh) way, as well as having an aroma with impact. Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate, and been in such high demand by consumers,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it."
3930,1352,Eleven,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,11.69999981,"Our Eleventh anniversy ale, released in July 2006 only is a Triple IPA made exclusively with Phoenix hops. 11.7% abv make this Triple IPA powerful, but the Phoenix hops keep it smooth.  Phoenix is another one of those hops with low cohumulone levels, which means  when used in very large quantities (as we do in Eleven) the hops flavor is very smooth, not a hint of harshness for the enormous amounts of hops in the brew.  As with all of our Anniversay ales, this one will age fantastically and will never be made again, as each anniversary is an entirely different brew."
3931,1352,Heresy,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,8,"This incredibly intriguing Imperial Stout is made by aging our Old Heathen in some very famous Oak barrels that were used for aging bourbon! What do we have when we are done? A stout whose very essence has been enhanced. A stout whose complexity has been increased. A stout with notes of Oak, whiskey and vanilla melding together to create a new sensation. Have we gone too far this time? We don't think so. Heresy is a step above and a leap beyond the extraordinary. Taste it and see what everyone is talking about. 8.0% ABV"
3932,1352,Hops Infusion,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.199999809,"Hops Infusion is loaded with piney, citrusy notes, much hops complexity, and a strong foundation of malt underneath it all.. Glowing a deep amber color, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe, Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, Saaz, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas, not found in any other beer.

Originally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open), Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again.

We brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV, 1.068 OG) all year 'round. So if your local beer store doesn't have it, tell 'em to get moving!"
3933,1352,House Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,4.5,"House Ale, our 4.5% session ale, was first brewed in 2006.  Our goal was to brew a beer that was a little bit lower in alcohol, but did not lack for body and flavor. We're sure you'll agree, that's just what we achieved with this tasty brew.  Brewed with Pale, Caramunich, and Carapils malt for flavor and body, then hopped exclusively with expensive Tettnang hops, a very delicate, delicious hops that perfectly fits this beer with just the right snap of flavor.   Available only in Pennsylvania, in our Variety Pack Case."
3934,1352,Imperial Pumpkin Ale,11,123,Pumpkin Beer,8,"Yes that's right!  The mother of all Pumpkin Ales is currently in transit to our wholesalers and should be out on shelves around mid-September.  This 8.0% ABV pumpkin ale is heartier, spicier, and more ""caramelly"" and ""pumpkiny"" than its faint brethren!  
  Perfect finisher on a cool autumn night, or match it up with a slice of pumpkin pie and fresh whipped cream.  
  If you don't agree this is the mother of all pumpkin ales, then you just don't like mothers!"
3935,1352,Insanity,3,35,American-Style Barley Wine Ale,11.10000038,"Insanity, just released this past November, 2004, is Weyerbacher's latest creation in the world of cutting edge beers. Insanity is made by aging our perfectly balanced Blithering Idiot Barleywine in  oak bourbon casks. This incredible combination creates a melange of flavors such as malt, dates, oak, vanilla, and bourbon just to name a few.

  Insanity is 11.1% ABV. It is best enjoyed in a brandy snifter and served at 45-50 degrees F."
3936,1352,Muse Farmhouse Ale,5,74,French & Belgian-Style Saison,6.199999809,"Muse, a Farmhouse Ale,  is brewed ""somewhat"" in the tradition of the style, but it has Weyerbacher fingerprints all over it! Made with Pale malt, a little carapils, raw wheat and raw oats, this warm weather seasonal is dry and ever so slightly tart on the pallet from the wheat and oats. At 6.2% abv, its a bit higher than your strictly traditional farmhouse, but not out of the realm, really. The wheat and oats makes the mouthfeel silky and light at the same time.  They also bring some cloudiness to the brew, but don't be afraid!  Hopped with Styrian Goldings and finished with Saaz, this beer has a noticable hoppy dryness which makes it a fine thirst quencher, something the original Farmhouse Ales were intended to be, served to workers out in the fields on hot summer days as a restorative.
Fermented with Forbidden Fruit yeast, at a very high temperature (78F), the spiciness developed is entirely from this traditional yeast strain, not from any kettle additions. Unfiltered, to enjoy this natural beauty, and imagine yourself out in the flat fields of Belgium! Cheers!"
3937,1352,Old Heathen,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,8,"Rich, velvety and deliciously complex, Old Heathen is a truly distinctive winter warmer. We use seven types of malt and two varieties of hops to bring forth this big brew. Quite robust and roasty on the palate, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. 

Old Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.

Like most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews, oysters, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts.

Old Heathen is now available year-round."
3938,1352,Prophecy,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,9.300000191,"Prophecy is our third ale to be aged in bourbon barrels. We've taken our Merry Monks' Ale and carefully aged it in bourbon barrels. The result is a fabulous unique ale, softened with hints of vanilla and oak, with an intriguing finish to it. Prophecy is a limited release so when it's here, be sure to grab a case or two to lay away before its gone. 9.3% ABV."
3939,1352,Quad,5,62,Belgian-Style Quadrupel,11.80000019,"Grand Champion in the 2000, and again in 2004 at United States Beer Tasting Championship, Weyerbacher QUAD is the first quadrupel style beer to be commercially brewed and bottled in the United States.

In December 2002 QUAD won Mid-Atlantic Champion at the USBTC for the third year in a row.

Massively big and delicious, QUAD is an elegant and dark ale. Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it after a long day or during a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine elixir. QUAD, with an alcohol content of 11.8% (by volume) is the strongest beer we make, so please pay proper accord as you enjoy it.

As with any higher alcohol beers, QUAD will be at its best after a period of 6 or 12 months in the bottle, perhaps longer.

3940,1352,Raspberry Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,8,"Enjoyed alone as a winter-warmer or as the perfect finish to any fine meal, our Raspberry Imperial Stout is a wonderfully full-flavored beer with just a ""kiss"" of raspberry flavor. 
When we brew this beer we add just a touch of real raspberries during the fermentation process. The result is a modest fruit flavor which enhances--- without dominating the rich, malty, stout taste.

Our Raspberry Imperial Stout (8.0% ABV) is great alone or as an after-dinner accompaniment. It's especially good with chocolate desserts. We brew it only during the winter months, so check out the Brewing Schedule on the ""What's New""  page for the next time it will be coming to a beer store near you."

Checking in at 10.2% abv, Twelve is being released in July and through the end of the year.   Made from 50% Rye Malt and 50% Barley Malt, this strong ale is extremely viscous. The rye adds a tantalizing note of flavor on the palate with a hint of tartness you've come to expect from Rye.  Slightly warm when its young, the beer will age very well, perhap 5 years or more.  We're guessing that peak taste will be in the 1 to 2 year old range, with 3 and 4 not far behind.  Be sure to lay some down in your collection."

Malty and roasty on the palate, and with distinctive caramel notes, this beer will satisfy the desires of any malty beer aficionado. 

Weyerbacher Scotch Ale is our interpretation of a beer style originating from Scotland, where the chilly damp weather calls for a hearty beer. Lacking the preservative powers of hops, scotch ales were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.7% ABV (alcohol by volume) Weyerbacher Scotch Ale definitely contains a warming belt.

We brew Weyerbacher Scotch Ale mostly in the cooler months of the year. Check out the Upcoming Events and Beers page for the next time it will be at a beer store near you."

Furthermore, the tradition was adopted by the Vikings that brought Christianity to the country between 1000 and 1100. They moved the tradition to December in connection with the birth of Jesus. 
In those days a farmer that did not set aside the best crop to produce the beer could lose his house to the king and the church. The law has been changed, but we promise you that we still use the very best of malt, yeast, hops, and pure Norwegian water to produce our Christmas beer.

4039,1173,Southern Tier IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.5,"IPA stands for India Pale Ale and ours is an American version of the classic style.  IPA's namesake lies in its colonial roots.  British soldiers on their way to India drank a lot of beer, but found it would go stale on the long voyages.  Meanwhile, brewers knew that by adding more hops the beer would stay fresh.  Voila!

It is unfiltered so the characteristic cloudiness is achieved. The haze comes from suspended yeast. Hefe-Weizen literally means ""yeast-wheat."" The aroma is reminiscent of cloves and banana and is put out by the yeast. While some of this aroma carries over to the flavor, the dominant flavor is the malty wheat.

4057,551,Hop Knot IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6,"Our Hop Knot IPA is made only from American malt and lots of American hops, which produce a big, broad-shouldered, hoppy beer backed up by a character as warm as, well, Mom and apple pie...

Hop Knot is an ale that is to be enjoyed with friends, spicy food or any time you need a good hop fix without the harsh bitterness.

4060,551,Oatmeal Stout,1,21,Oatmeal Stout,5,"Our Oatmeal Stout is definitely a local favorite but it gets its origins from one of London's oldest breweries. The Oatmeal Stout differs from the popular Irish stout in its more subtle roastiness and subdued dryness.

4065,551,Barrel-Aged Blind Date Ale,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,7.5,"This is the old tried and true Blind Date Ale of old. It is based on an English Olde Ale but has an addition of 300 pounds of Arizona grown Medjool dates. The dates contribute a complexity and sweetness that the malt alone cannot. This Blind Date has been aged for three months in Jim Beam oak bourbon barrels. The oak and bourbon lend flavors of vanilla, wood, and of course, bourbon. These flavors layered with the dates created a big, multi-leveled ale. The alcohol content is about 7.5% alc/vol.

4066,551,Belgian Wit,5,67,Belgian-Style White,0,"Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced ""Who Garden"") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!

Belgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. 

You will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove. Our version of a Belgian Wit is called ""Hoof - Hearted Wit,"" and it is brewed to style with dried bitter and sweet orange peel and coriander seeds."
4068,551,Black Betty Schwartzbier,7,86,German-Style Schwarzbier,5,"This almost black lager originates from Germany and is most closely associated with Porter. The difference being the long maturation period (or lagering time) required to produce a true Schwartzbier. The flavor is reminiscent of treacle, coffee and toasted malt. It is not and should not be perceived as burnt or ashy like some stouts. Black Betty has 5% alc/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.

The name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940's which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others."

Topped with a creamy head, it gives off a light, fruity apricot aroma produced by the fermentation. The taste perceived in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruity nuances noticed in the fragrance. 

Its taste, which imparts a silky sensation to the tongue, is made refreshing by a light touch of bitterness. To the palate, the taster perceives a pleasant astringency which complements the flavour qualities of this beer very harmoniously.

This top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised."
4073,378,Chimay Triple (Chimay White),5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,8,"Named Cinq Cents in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, this beer with its typical golden colour, its slightly hazy appearance and its fine head is especially characterised by its aroma which results from an agreeable combination of fresh hops and yeast. 

The beer's flavour, as sensed in the mouth, comes from the smell of hops: above all it is the fruity notes of muscat and raisins that give this beer a particularly attractive aroma. 

The aroma complements the touch of bitterness. There is no acidity, but an after-bitterness which melts in the mouth.

This top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised."

There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips. The aftertaste is clean.""

Rogue brewer John Maier describes his Brutal Bitter as a cross between a Very Extra Special Bitter and an Indian Pale Ale. Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Customer demand prompted Rogue to continue brewing Brutal for the Horse Brass as well as using it as Rogues premier pour at the 1998 Oregon Brewers Festival. At the 1999 SpringFest in Portland, Oregon, Brutal Bitter was unscientifically voted the Peoples Choice--it received twice as many votes as the runner-up.

Brutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping. The English malts used are floor malted Pipkin (a mellow cross of Maris Otter and Warboys, from an English company called Beeston), Cara Vienna and Cara Wheat.

I hope the brewery bottles some before it disappears."" We call it the cognac of beers. An unfiltered and unfined Barleywine. Intense, robust, malty and dark. The cognac of beers. A hugh beer in a little bottle, this is a beer designed for sipping.

Soba (also known as buckwheat) is not a type of wheat but a member of the rhubard family (a fruit, not a grain!) Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).

Morimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness. Morimoto Soba Ale is available in a 22 ounce silkscreened bottle and 13.2 gallon sankey kegs.

Gerard and Patrick McAleese asked John Maier to create a beer with a green apple bite flavor profile. It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted.

""Draught Guinness* and ""Foreign Extra Stout"" are the two primary types brewed in Ireland. Foreign Extra is the one I have emulated. It is closer in style to the London Porters of old than to modern stout. Very dark and rich, not as dry as Draught, about 6% abv and around 60 IBUs (that's hop bitterness). I used ""First Gold"" hops because that's what I could get. Guinness use Nitrogen mixed with carbon dioxide to dispense their stout which adds to the creamy mouth-feel. BTW: The ""Imported"" Guinness you buy here in the US comes from Canada. It could just as well be brewed in the US but the common wisdom in the brewing world is that Americans prefer ""imported"" beers and will pay more for them."

""The high hopping of Harpoon IPA is not only noticeable in the nose but especially in the finish. The lingering bitter finish of this beer is not harsh or astringent, but crisp and pronounced. This is created, in part, by dry hopping -  a technique that involves adding fresh hops to the conditioning beer to provide a fresh hop aroma.

This beer is floral, medium body with an aggressive, clean hop finish.""

----

This has been my year-round favorite since moving to Boston in 2004.  It is the nectar of the gods.  Seriously, it's a nicely balanced, hoppy IPA that isn't overpowering.  Also, it can be consumed in huge quantities with no hangover."
4420,634,Harpoon UFO Hefeweizen,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,4.800000191,"From Harpoon's site:

""UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer.  Perhaps UFO's initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.

The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeast's fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.

The overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.  Serve with a lemon."""
4421,634,Harpoon Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5,"From Harpoon's site:

""When first seeing Harpoon Ale in a glass, you will notice its golden caramel color. You will also see that it is not excessively carbonated. High carbonation would mask this beer's subtle flavor. The first aroma will be fruity. This is produced by the yeast and is a signature characteristic of Harpoon's proprietary yeast strain. The second perceptible aroma is from the malt, with a delicate caramel note. Upon tasting Harpoon Ale, you will find that the malty, fruity character is nicely balanced by the mild hop bitterness. It has a smooth, medium body. The finish of this beer is crisp but not dry.


The overall character of this beer is fruity, balanced, and mild."""

It has a unique and extremely complex brewing process whereby the brand is first top fermented and then is refermented within the bottle - ending up in a unique cloudy-white appearance. The brand's unique appearance is mirrored by its one-of-a-kind taste - sweet and sour beer with a little bitterness, slightly spicy, with a strong touch of coriander and a hint of orange, perfect for warm summer days, instead of other refreshing beverages. Refreshing, a little quirky, and decidedly different - naturally."

As soon as we wrapped up the brewing of the Stone 10th Anniversary IPA, we started brainstorming ideas for the Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, and the Black IPA concept was born. This was a challenging brew to formulate and achieve what we considered the ideal flavor balance of intense up-front hops with balanced roasted malt flavors, a deep, rich flavor, and a hearty bitterness."

Gumballhead is brewed from red wheat and amarillo hops. It has a medium haze, due to bottle conditioning; once the beer is bottled, extra yeast is added for a secondary fermentation.

4428,39,Anchor Summer Beer,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,4.599999905,"Anchor Summer is the first American wheat beer in modern times. Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.

Anchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting ""ale"" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.

The brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.

Summer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and this-combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheat-makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.

Our Lion's Gate Lager has a light body, a very crisp palate and a soft, hop finish, which is imparted by the exquisitely gentle Czech Saaz hop variety. The Lions would approve."

Caramel and honey malts lend this ale a mellow, grainy maltiness which is balanced by the subtle presence of English finishing hops. Cheers, our Cascadia Cream Ale will be sure to brighten up even the wettest West Coast day."
4434,1195,Signature Pale Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,0,"The term ""Pale Ale"" dates back to the 1800s when all beer was dark brown in colour. New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish."
4436,1195,Empress India Pale Ale,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,0,"During the heyday of the British Empire, India Pale Ale was born as a strong pale ale brewed especially to endure the rigors of the long journey to the colonies. In order to guard against spoilage, I.P.A. was brewed with a high alcohol content and with liberal amounts of hops, which act as a natural preservative. This ale's golden amber colour only hints at its full-bodied flavour. Its sumptuous maltiness is tempered by a goodly amount of bitterness and a mouth-filling hop flavour. In order to finish our I.P.A. with a truly fresh hop bouquet, we dry hop this ale in the serving tank with both East Kent Goldings and Mount Hood hops."

Hefe is the German word for 'yeast' and weizen means 'wheat'. This beer is made with 40% wheat malt and is brewed with a special yeast that tends to stay in suspension, giving the beer its cloudy appearance. Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour. All of these wacky flavours are the natural 'signature' left by this specific yeast strain during its fermentation of the beer and no additional spices are added."

Because of its high strength this beer has an intensely fruity palate. Up front it has a honeyish sweetness but the finish is dry and champagne-like.

4446,1210,HURRICANE I.P.A.,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,0,"'A complex, flavourful and fascinating ale lies just on the edge of being totally out of control.' -Stephan Beaumont, Celebrator Beer News

India Pale Ale dates back to the 1700's when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness."

4448,1210,Highland Scottish Ale,1,15,Scotch Ale,0,"While hugely popular in Scotland, this style of beer escapes most North Americans. Designed and brewed by the Scottish punk rocker David 'Malty' Macanulty, this creamy, nutty, malty, dark ale is true to its origins. David drives James crazy over this beer, insisting on rigid fermentation temperatures, traditional mild hops for bittering, and even some weird caramelizing ritual as the kettle is being filled. The beer continues to undergo subtle evolutionary changes because the stubborn Scottish bastard will never be satisfied."

All three of the lambics - Raspberry, Blackberry and Black Cherry - are aged in oak casks for more than one year. 15 kg, give or take, of whole unpasteurized fruit is added to each 200 litre oak barrel of fermented beer. The naturally occurring wild yeasts cause a second, slow fermentation, breaking down the fruit sugars to total dryness."

Hop Henge Imperial IPA returns to the Bond Street Series line-up this April in extreme fashion. Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the 'never settle' philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last year's monument to hops.

Head Brewer Brett Porter says, 'This is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.' In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.

The team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.

Limited Availability April through June.

Don't miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.

-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx

Available April through June.

Hop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.

Like the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.

Alcohol By Volume: 8.1%
	

IBU 95

When one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.

5 out 5 stars 
Hop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to 'Imperial IPA' status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.
'This one is lovely,' said taster Tom Conti. 'They got it just right.'
It pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. 'They sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[there's] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,' one taster observed.
In addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.
This was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. 'This is a beautiful beer,' concluded taster Gregg Glaser. 'Full of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.'
'Not for the timid,' said taster Robert Lachman.

4639,314,Bube's Red Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,0,This was the first draught on tap in November 2001. It has developed to a very quaffable ale. the slight sweet malt flavor is balanced with East Kent Golding hops to produce this delicious reddish-amber ale.
4640,314,Bube's Stout,3,42,American-Style Stout,0,This dark full bodied stout is perfect with a meal or as a meal. Rolled oats give this beer an enjoyable mouthfeel while chocolate and roasted malts lend to its distinctive flavor.
4641,314,Bube's Kiwi-Strawberry Wheat,11,121,Fruit Beer,0,The perfect thirst quenching summertime ale. The subtle flavor of kiwi and strawberry blend with traditional German wheat and hops. Great for a hot summer day.
4642,314,Bube's Brown Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,0,"Another one of our first recipes, which we have improved with experience. This ale is pleasantly malty with nutty and toffee like undertones. East Kent Golding hops were used to compliment this English style ale."
4643,314,Bube's Hefeweizen,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,0,"This traditional German-style wheat beer is rich in banana and clove undertones, with a wonderful frothy head."
4644,314,Bube's India Pale Ale (IPA),3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,0,"Bube's rendition of this classic style is made with fine 2-row malted barley and West Coast hops. A wonderful malt finish with a delicate citrus aroma, reminiscent of its Old-World cousin."
4645,1286,Scratch #7 2008,4,55,South German-Style Weizenbock,7.900000095,"Red and white wheat combined with darker malts add body to this hazy, unfiltered ale.  Fermented with the same yeast as DreamWeaver Wheat replicating the pepper, clove and all-spice flavors found in our year-round beer."
4646,1286,Scratch #11 2008,1,3,Ordinary Bitter,4.900000095,"Next up, we present Scratch Beer #11-2008, a Bitter. Back in the day, we used to brew a little number called Troegs ESB. Even though this beer was retired almost six years ago, we still get numerous Troegs old-schoolers (Martha) begging for its return.

Well hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chris' stint at England's University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chris' experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.

The Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. It's not the ESB, but it's damn special."
4647,1286,Scratch #10 2008,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,10.19999981,"he third time just might be the charm-Scratch #10-2008 is our third triple in the Scratch Beer series.

This grand cru has been lovingly aged since late-February, yet still unleashes the slightest hint of alcohol heat.

Scratch #10-2008 also has a triple flavor inspiration combining the caramel/toffee notes of dememera sugar and molasses, with citrus and licorice flavors created by the orange peel and star anise; lastly we create a peppery/spicy finish with the same trappist yeast has been used in each Scratch Beer Triple."
4648,1286,Scratch #8 2008,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,10.10000038,"Revisiting Scratch #3, we take the same Tripel recipe, add beet and cane sugars to the kettle, and run the wort through our hopback brimming with juniper berries, coriander and yarrow flowers.

Inspired by the herbaceous nose of gin, the berries and flowers give a slight pine/citrus aroma with floral undertones. Scratch #8 has a dry, yeasty finish and noticeable alcohol warming when consumed."
4649,1286,Scratch #6 2007,8,95,American-Style Lager,5.099999905,"Old world brewing techniques combine with Noble hops for Scratch #6-2007.
This Export Lager features a single stage decoction-a first for Troegs Brewery. After combining barley and water we transfer a portion of the mash to the brew kettle for a quick boil. The heated mash is then returned to the mash kettle and the brewing process continues. This process deepens the malt character and adds a subtle toffee backbone to this delicious lager.

We've added Magnum hops for bittering and Czech Saaz hops for aroma to create a classic European Noble hop flavor. 

Scratch #6-2007 is unfiltered, so there will be a slight haze to the beer."

4658,90,Cask Hefe,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,0,It is a good clean hefe.
4659,459,Raison D'Etre,3,29,Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale,8,"A deep, mahogany ale brewed with beet sugar, green raisins, and Belgian-style yeast. As complex as a fine, red wine. Voted ""American Beer of the Year"" in January 2000 by Malt Advocate Magazine."

After fermentation a fraction of the batch is aged in Oregon Pinot Noir barrels, and another fraction is aged on oak staves. The beer is blended together before packaging.

This has been one of our most popular Limited Edition beers at both our Rehoboth Beach, DE brewpub and at festivals. It successfully marries the refreshing citrusy qualities of a Belgian-style white beer with the robust complexity of a bold red wine."

With just 95 calories and full-flavor, Kirin Light is one of the few great world-class Lights.

You might think Kirin Light would be a lightweight contender, content to let his sturdier siblings steal the show. But this fitness-minded newcomer won't compromise. You won't have to compromise either - with just 95 calories and full flavor, Kirin Light is one of the few great world-class lights.

What makes Kirin Light great
Canadian barley malt, Czech hops, rich golden color"
4669,459,Chateau Jiahu,11,126,Herb and Spice Beer,9.5,"9000 year old Chateau Jiahu stands apart as the most ancient, chemically-attested alcoholic beverage in the world. Its recreation is based on painstaking excavation by Chinese archaeologists of Jiahuin the Yellow River basin, state-of-the-art microanalysis of pottery residues by American laboratories, and the inspired ""Neolithic"" brewing of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Chateau Jiahu, then as now, opens a window into the world of our ancestors."
4670,1248,Pipe Organ Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,4.900000095,"When the British introduced draught pale ale to America, the Pipe Organ Pale Ale is what they had intended. It is truly British in character. Brewed with pale ale malt and a touch of caramel malt, it has a light copper color and subtle body. The maltiness is carefully balanced with only the best English hops - East Kent Goldings. Although this beer has a fair amount of hops, the caramel maltiness perfectly balances its profile."
4672,1248,Millennium Trippel,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,9,A Belgian Trippel is a very special type of beer. A Belgian Trippel could be called the beer version of a Champagne. It is very light in color and highly carbonated giving an appearance similar to Champagne. The flavor is somewhat sweet and malty as well as strong.
4673,1248,Celestial Gold,7,77,German-Style Pilsener,4.099999905,"This beer is golden in color with a light bubbly effervescence. The light body makes this lager beer appropriate for a business lunch or your evening sipping beer. The light malt flavor also accentuates the hop flavor. From the start, you will notice a fine hop aroma. As you sip the Celestial Gold, the subdued maltiness blends with a slight hop flavor. When this beer finishes, you will notice a pleasant hop bitterness. The bitterness will be mild and quite appropriate. Celestial Gold has been known to induce Celestial bliss."
4674,1248,Blast Furnace Oatmeal Stout,1,21,Oatmeal Stout,4.800000191,"Stouts have typically been a staple beverage in the UK.  There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.

At the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have -  and we didn't stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.

We used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.

A typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We don't think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore."
4675,1248,Church Brew Oktoberfest,7,84,German-Style Oktoberfest,5.199999809,Our Oktoberfest is a light amber colored beer.  It is malty in both flavor and aroma making it a delicate beer which is very drinkable. The hop bitterness is kept low to accentuate the maltiness.  Notice the crisp clean character and enjoy.  We brewed three batches of this beer so that we can bottle some of it in order to enhance our bottle beer selection.
4676,1248,Mad Brewer Maibock,7,91,German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock,7,"A bock beer is required by German law to start at 17 Plato.   For those who are interested,  Plato is a measurement of the sugar content before fermentation.  It is a very malty lager beer with medium hop bitterness.  A maibock is a light to amber colored bock beer.  A Maibock is very similar to a Helles/pale bock.  Maibocks were originally brewed for the coming of spring, hence the name Mai (German for May).  The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, it is very different in character.  Don't let it get you though, it's a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.  The hop bitterness is evident, but not dominant.  The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness."
4677,1248,Heavenly Hefeweizen,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,4.5,"I'm sure everyone here knows, Pittsburgh has some humid summers.  What can you do to escape the heat and enjoy yourself?  Well I've got the answer.  How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because I'm going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages."
4678,1286,Scratch #12 2008,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.5,"In our never-ending pursuit of answering the burning question of what's new, we present Scratch #12-2008, an IPA.
 
The IPA is a fickle beast; too much malt and you veer into a high-octane hopbomb, while too little hops can question a beer's virility. In these chaotic days of shrinking hop harvests, balance is key to a proper IPA. Scratch #12-2008 delivers an intense pine nose married with a subtle wildflower aroma. The Thames Valley yeast adds an earthy nod to traditional English IPAs, while the American hops provide a bold contrasting bitterness.
 
Breath deep, relax, enjoy."
4679,690,Jupiler,7,77,German-Style Pilsener,5.199999809,"Jupiler is the most famous and most popular beer in Belgium.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.

The funny thing about that is the Webster dictionary defines a ""meter maid"" as ""a female member of a police department who is assigned to write tickets for parking violations."" You have to wonder how the male ""meter maids"" feel about that! Parking Violation is an American style pale ale using lots of American hops, lots of quarters, and several trips back and forth to the parking lot.

We call Beer Esteem a California Common because it is brewed with a lager yeast and it is fermented at warmer ale temperatures.

Plentiful pale malt creates beautiful, agile body. Assertive hops and Belgian yeast achieve charismatic floral and spice notes in aroma and flavor. But Pride's predominant and unique character comes from its exposure to Brettanomyces in French oak Chardonnay barrels. At once tart and refreshing yet earthy and musty, Pride is unlike most beers on earth. And it's bitter, lingering finish demands another sip. 

Awarded a BRONZE medal at World Beer Cup 2008, Pride has much too much to boast about."
4835,858,Sloth,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,10.19999981,"SLOTH Belgian-style Imperial Stout is deliberately dark as hell. The pour is slow and sluggish. Its head is menacing, becoming torn and tattered Belgian lace on the sides of the glass as you cautiously consume this brew-sip by insidious sip. 

The aroma is sweet from heavy malt and big alcohol with notes of vanilla, coconut and whiskey from the oak. The depth & breadth of roasted malt flavors loiters on the palate while the robust finish lingers, well, forever. 

SLOTH...Just add couch."
4836,858,Wrath,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,8.199999809,"WRATH Belgian-style Double IPA is fiercely bitter with notes of spice and earth. Its fury slowly and purposefully unfurls on the tongue, relentlessly bringing on more and more enraged flavor with each sip.

4837,858,Greed,5,64,Belgian-Style Pale Ale,5,"With a summer release in mind, GREED Belgian-style Single was created miserly-relatively speaking-with one type of malt and two varieties of hops. At 5% ABV and 30 IBUs, Greed is the lightest in our series of 2007 Deadly Sin Beers. However, the Belgian yeast used in fermentation and conditioning contributes an earthy, somewhat spicy flavor and a crisp finish. We invite you to be greedy before it's gone.

It is widely held that the darker the beer, the stronger the beer, but this is a summarily false.  The contribution of color comes directly from the color of malt that we use.

Our celebratory brew starts with a black pepper and ginger nose. The nicely carbonated brew releases a honey-malt flavor that gives way to a tart crisp finish that masks the elevated ABV.

We use a blended yeast strain (Saison Dupont & Le Chouffe) to create the traditional peppery, spicy earthy flavors of the saison. Slight hints of ginger also come through in the finish.

4960,1149,Bengali Tiger,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.5,"Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA. In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hops... Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aroma... we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; it's the mark of the Tiger."

4963,604,Wild Raspberry Ale,11,121,Fruit Beer,5.599999905,"What better way to surprise a beer lover than with a fruit beer that tastes like beer? Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.

Our efforts do not go unrewarded -  Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer."

Spanning all 26 of our states from the Pacific to the Atlantic, our Beer Rangers do their best to protect, to pour and to partake. And explore many a beer from many a brewery, they do.

So, here it finally is -  New Belgium's foray into the true American India Pale Ales. Bring out the hops! This clear amber beauty bursts at the starting gate with an abundance of hops: Cascade (citrus), Chinook (floral/citrus), and Simcoe (fruity) lead off the beer, with Cascade added again for an intense dry hop flavor.

Historical facts or fictions aside, Yards Brewing Company has recreated Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale to celebrate Franklin's affinity for fine ales. Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale is based on Franklin's original recipe, which called for spruce essence and molasses, as barley and hops were not readily available at the time.

Consistent with the hefeweizen style, this beer is unfiltered and cloudy with a solid foamy head.  UFO Raspberry has a distinctive, hazy rose color.  The scent of fresh raspberries hits the nose immediately, along with a subtle bready aroma from the wheat and yeast.  The body is light and the unfiltered yeast provides a soft mouthfeel.  The taste of the fruit compliments the beer nicely, neither overwhelms the other.  There is a faint sweetness on the palate, which finishes cleanly in a semi-dry, tart finish."

This is the first year-round Harpoon beer the brewery has released in almost a decade.  While the craft beer industry has seen a growing trend in ""extreme"" beers, the brewers of Harpoon wanted to create something they could sit down and enjoy over an extended period of time - a session beer.  At 4.3% alcohol by volume, the Harpoon Brown Ale has the lowest alcohol content of all Harpoon beers.

Harpoon Brown Ale will be available in bottles and on draft beginning in March 2007.  An evening of celebrations to toast the beer's release will be held at locations throughout New England on Thursday, March 8th, including tastings at Harpoon's breweries in Boston, MA and Windsor, VT"

4992,1009,High Tide IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.5,"ach and every fall, we experience a coastal experience in San Diego known as the ""Super High Tide."" This happens later in the Fall Season when the tidal swings reach a range of about 8 feet in difference between low and high tides. When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.

While waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA? Brewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can't normally get. Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them."

The first in the Series was ""Is"", a dark and bitter Russian Imperial Stout. ""Oat"" is the follow up; an Oatmeal Stout with major alcohol volume and tons of body to back it up. The cloying character of the oats in this brew lends itself to a chewy and almost oily mouthfeel. ABV. is off the charts at about 12.5%.

5022,314,Wet Hop Requiem IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,5.199999809,"This beauty is a complete work of art! Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven.

5040,1251,Devotion,5,64,Belgian-Style Pale Ale,6.25,"It's an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It's always been a simple life -  the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.

Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion."

5052,923,Havre Stout,1,21,Oatmeal Stout,4.5,"We usually do not make compromises, but this is probably the exception.  Norwegians are dead scared of dark beers.  This is an attempt to show that there are gentle dark ales.  As such Havre Stout is smooth and drinkable."
5053,923,Nogne o Saison,5,74,French & Belgian-Style Saison,6.5,"One of our most refreshing brews, made for those hot summer days, but satisfying year 'round. Recommended serving temperature 8 C/45 F. Goes well with seafood, particularly oysters."

5055,923,Nogne o Imperial Brown Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,7.5,"There is a long story to this malty ale.

It is the perfect thing to drink with almost any cheese."

5063,1286,Scratch #15 2008,1,21,Oatmeal Stout,6,"Scratch #15-2008 is our first collaborative beer in the Scratch series. We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a Double Espresso Oatmeal Stout.

The double in the name refers to the espresso (not the alcohol). Scratch #15's espresso blend is a medium city-type roast featuring beans from three continents. St. Thomas Roasters roasted and ground the beans; we used them in our hopback. At the end of the boil the hot wort passed through the espresso beans to give a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor.

Chocolate, roasted and caramel malt flavors stand out, while the addition of oats gives Scratch #15 a full, round mouth feel. Galena and Ken Goldings hops are added to balance the overall flavor and not drive up the bitterness. The head retention diminishes quickly because of the oils from the espresso beans."
5065,1142,Chico Estate Harvest Ale,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.699999809,"We wanted to see if we could grow hops at our brewery in Chico, California so we planted our own hop field selecting our prized Cascade and Centennial varieties along with some specialty hop varieties to experiment with. To our surprise, we not only could grow hops, we were also able to harvest them in late summer due to Chico's ideal climate. 

Chico Estate Harvest Ale is one of the very few estate harvest ales produced anywhere in the world today. All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years."
5066,1142,Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop  Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,6.699999809,"Our newest addition to our Harvest family is Southern Hemisphere Harvest. This is the first time we know of that an American brewer has put out a beer with fresh-picked hops from the southern hemisphere. The inaugural ale will debut in late April and will feature fresh Pacific Hallertau, New Zealand Motueka and New Zealand Southern Cross hops, all from New Zealand. 

Like our Celebration Ale, the fresh hops in this beer are dried right after being picked then shipped immediately to Chico for brewing so that they retain their peak aromatics and flavors. To ensure the freshest hops possible, we went to the added expense of flying these hops from New Zealand to Chico so we could brew with them the week after they were picked."

Brewed with Pale, Carahell and Wheat malts, Amarillo and Cascade hops. This medium bodied beer is crisp on the palate with a smooth, not overly bitter hops flavor coupled with the fruity esters from the Belgian Abby yeast strain we used. Its bottle and keg conditioned, so expect a tall, fluffy head, and perhaps small amount of sediment. Just one batch was brewed in April 2008, kegs released in late May, and only 20 cases of bottles for sale only at the brewery at the special debut night event of June 13, 2008, from 5 to 8 pm. Recipe by Jeff Musselman, assistant brewer."

5133,68,Calico Amber Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,5,"The Calico Amber Ale was inspired by the beers of England. In England most of the beer is some kind of ""bitter"".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name ""bitter.""  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called ""bitter"" or ""ordinary bitter.""  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us ""best bitter"" or ""special bitter.""  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an ""extra special bitter"" or E.S.B.

Although inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale."
5134,68,Black Marlin Porter,2,25,Porter,6,Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter is a rich dark chocolaty Porter with a distinctive American hop character.

5135,68,Wahoo Wheat Beer,5,67,Belgian-Style White,4,"Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or ""white"" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark. Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is the perfect beer for sunny San Diego."
5136,954,Orange Blossom Pilsner ,11,121,Fruit Beer,11,"When you make a pot of coffee, but only use half the water, you get some pretty rich coffee. That's the approach we took with our latest offering. OBP Squared, with half the water, has 11% alcohol by volume-twice that of original OBP.

5142,1287,Phuket Lager,8,95,American-Style Lager,5,"Phuket Beer was created as a refreshing 'boutique' beer in view of the exotic island of Phuket with a much lower formula of bitterness than any other domestic rivals in Thailand.

Phuket Beer is the first regional beer brewed in Thailand and is positioned to appeal to both the international markets as well as the local population. This is manifested through the label and packaging designs presented in both English and Thai languages.

Phuket Beer is well positioned as a premium brand located somewhere between the local standard brands and the imported premium brands. The efforts were inspired from the feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.

The philosophy is to provide a 'tropical lifestyle' drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content."
5143,881,Monteith's Summer Ale,11,126,Herb and Spice Beer,5,"Monteith's Summer Ale is a refreshingly different beer. The opportunity to rediscover some flavour highlights of beer styles enjoyed on summer days past, and bring them back to life.

At the end of last century, in England, Europe and the Americas and in New Zealand, there was still an adherence to brew with barley, wholesome grains, hops and other traditional brewing spices.

Monteith's Summer Ale is a bright gold beer with great body from four different malts. Spiced with a single hop variety and a touch of history - a little Rata honey. Subtle, but enough to make all the difference. The result is a truly refreshing herbal spiced beer brewed for the Summer Season - a splendid thirst quencher.

Monteith's Summer Ale enjoyed ice-cold with a simple range of fruits, perhaps refreshing wedge of orange or lime. Alternatively, match with summer salads and stir-frys to complement the light flavours."
5144,881,Monteith's Celtic Beer,2,22,Irish-Style Red Ale,4.400000095,"Monteith's Celtic Beer is considered an 'Irish-style ale' in the heritage of beers of a burnt-red colour traditionally brewed in the Emerald Isle.

Monteith's Celtic Beer has a dry roasted malt flavour characteristic of this style of brewing. This malty characteristic and crisp dryness is derived from malts of the roasted chocolate malt style. The hop character is medium to allow the chocolate malts to show through.

Monteith's brewers have been able to develop traditional ale fermentation characters while allowing the interesting roasted malt notes to come through in the aroma."
5145,1113,Scharer's Lager,8,95,American-Style Lager,5,"A traditional German-style lager, fermented at 7-9 C and lagered at 4 C for 4-6 weeks. The storage produces a soft, natural carbonation.

5154,1286,Scratch #16 2008,11,141,Winter Warmer,6.300000191,"Scratch #16-2008 combines the bitterness of two aroma hops, the lush sweetness of honey and malt and an earthly yeast taste creating a Winter Warmer designed to ward off the coldest days.

The dark, rich amber color comes from a combination of molasses and crystal malts; the Thames Valley brings a distinct earthly flavor; white the blend of hops creates fruity (Amarillo) and piney (Cluster) bitterness.

The Winter Warmer ends with a slight warming sensation from the elevated alcohol content.  Enjoy this one throughout the winter months.  Cheers."

Warming, mellow & pleasantly complex, Smuttynose Winter Ale is your perfect cold weather companion."
5157,1160,Shoals Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,4.699999809,"Our interpretation of a classic English beer style is copper-colored, medium-bodied and highly hopped. Its flavor is delightfully complex: tangy fruit at the start, with an assertive hop crispness and a long malty palate that one well-known beer writer has compared to the flavor of freshly-baked bread."
5158,1160,Old Brown Dog Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,5.900000095,"Old Brown Dog has been cited as a classic example of the 'American Brown Ale' style of beer. Compared to a typical English Brown Ale, Old Brown Dog is fuller-bodied and more strongly hopped.

Old Brown Dog has been around for many years. It was first brewed in 1988 at the Northampton Brewery. In 1989 it won a silver medal in its category (American Brown Ale) at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver."
5160,1160,Smuttynose Finestkind IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,5.599999905,"Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.

But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. 

Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: 'Why don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?'

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they'll be quite pleased."
5161,1160,Robust Porter,2,25,Porter,5.400000095,"This hearty, mahogany colored ale is brewed to evoke the dark, full-bodied ales that were a favorite of dockworkers and warehousemen (hence the name 'Porter') in 19th century London. It is a good bet that when Dickens' Mr. Pickwick sat down for a pint, we would have been drinking an ale much like our Robust Porter.This is a smooth and very drinkable beer, characterized by its well-balanced malt and hops, plus subtle notes of coffee and chocolate."

Gloriously gold in color, URANUS Golden Ale holds title to our first 100% Brettanomyces fermentation and conditioning. Brewed by mere mortals and blessed by the beer gods, this ale deserves to be worshipped."
5164,658,Black Mountain Bitter,1,3,Ordinary Bitter,0,"A style of Pale Ale, Black Mountain Bitter will be lightly hopped with traditional British hop varieties to balance the malt sweetness yet encourage it to tend toward the dry side. We recently received our organic certification from Clemson University after undergoing a rigid inspection and two-month compliance process. Although this represents a big step for Highland, the idea of an all organic product is consistent with our corporate ethos and embrace of natural traditional brewing methods."

We hereby pledge to provide him with an ample amount of our Presidential Pale Ale to support in the struggle for the aforementioned goals! Hail to the New Chief!"" 

So reads the label of Ale to the Chief, the latest limited release brew from Avery Brewing Company brewed to bid a fond farewell to our current Commander in Chief and welcome a new administration. Our thought process for this beer was rather simple: take the classic American Pale Ale, use American ingredients like West Coast Cascade hops and the American Ale yeast strain (a first for Avery Brewing) and produce a beer in the Avery tradition with intense, in-your-face flavor. This Presidential Pale Ale has a pungent nose of citrusy, green Cascade hops along with a medium body and a lingering bitter finish.

5166,1081,White Horse Hefeweizen,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,4.699999809,"This German inspired wheat ale is packed full of citrus flavor. We use torrified wheat, pale, and carafoam for balance, giving it a nice hazy, straw color and refreshing wheat taste. We ferment the White Horse at higher ale temps with a German style yeast that is known for producing world class wheat beers. We let the yeast take over the majority of the flavoring in our fermenters, providing the beer with banana and clove like esters. We pull some of the yeast with it to give this brew the proper style and to keep its body and character. We than age this brew with zests of citrus and a brewers spice that blends harmoniously with the esters of the yeast and balance out the sweetness of this brew.

We take so much pride in it because there is truly nothing else like it on the market. We brew this American Style Lager beer with three types of malt: pilsner, pale and carafoam which enhance the head retention of this beer. We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager. Truly our customers' favorite, this one will have you reaching for another glass soon after you put the first one down."

The pale and toasted malts used, provide a pie crust taste and smell in the beer as the higher alcohol's produced round out the finish."
5171,1081,Daddy Fat Sacs Imperial IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,7.5,"The one and only IPA that doesn't leave your pallet with a bitter after taste. This beer took years of practice to get down and when we finally got it right, we knew it. The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added ""big sacks"" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew."

We were totally blown away by the flavors that were created by this beer.

This is not just a more intense version of our spring seasonal Samuel Adams White Ale.  Imperial White is a new recipe that stands on it own merits.  In fact, it is more of a wine substitute than just another refreshing witbier.  This is a beer that should be sipped and savored and you"

The recipe calls for hops to be used in every step of the brewing process; in the mash, in a hop back, in the fermenter, and in the bright tanks.

But take heart. Even the longest, darkest winter gives way to spring and a new sense of optimism that the best is just ahead. That thought-and an itchy wool robe-sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. 

So when you're stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.

A traditional German Maibock with a deep, golden color, malty-sweet aroma, and clean finish from Magnum and Czech Saaz hops."
5313,656,Dundee Porter,2,25,Porter,6.5,"More and more we're becoming a nation of milquetoasts. And nowhere is that more evident than in our beer-puny liquids without calories, carbs, or cojones. 

But it needn't be that way, my friend! Sure, we don't want to make a living shoveling coal or washing clothes on a rock. But we can recapture the more robust spirit of a time gone by.

Dundee Porter is a throwback to a different era-when times were tough and so were the people. They drank big beers, slapped each other on the back, and toasted the good life-even though they only saw it from a distance. 

With Dundee Porter, you can get a taste of it.

Big and malty flavor from aromatic dark-roasted grains balanced by a subtle hint of hops. Deep color and rich caramel flavor."
5314,656,Dundee Wheat Beer,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,4.199999809,"Senator Joseph McCarthy. The Hollow Earth Society. Members of the Spanish Inquisition. All convinced they were blessed with the gift of clarity. And proof that clarity might be overrated. 

Sometimes, being unclear-and a little flexible-is a good thing. Like when you are looking for the perfect refreshment. Dundee Wheat Beer combines wheat and yeast into a refreshing hefeweizen-style brew. Unfiltered, so it is slightly cloudy and pleasantly unclear. 

So the next time you're convinced you're right about what you've been drinking, give a little 'unclarity' a try.

An American-style, unfiltered wheat beer. Pale straw in color with a light cloudiness from carefully selected wheat and yeast. Pleasant spicy malt aroma and a crisp hop finish."
5315,656,Dundee Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5.300000191,"Behold the hop. A flower, but too unsightly to be used for decoration. The ugly duckling of the flower family. 

Oh, but the secret it holds. Soak it in some water with the right companions and it surrenders its bouquet to use a corny flower metaphor. That unique hop flavor is the difference between a fine pale ale and more ordinary beers. 

Dundee Pale Ale understands the secret of the hop flower-the power to turn an ordinary beer into something extraordinary. 

And the power to make you indescribably hoppy. 

A wonderfully balanced true pale ale. Cascade, Tomahawk, and Amarillo hops create a citrusy aroma with a smooth, crisp finish. A subdued malt character nicely complements the hop complexity and produces an orangey amber hue."
5316,656,Dundee India Pale Ale,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.300000191,"It takes a bit of seasoning to understand that bitter can be a good thing. 

When you're a child, you want everything to be sweet. When you're a teenager, you want everything to be sweeeeet. But when you get a bit wiser and acquire some taste, you realize that bitter is an excellent alternative. It's a sign of complexity. It's a sign of maturity. It's a sign of the times. Face it, modern life demands a little bitterness every once in a while. 

When you are in the mood for something bitter, Dundee IPA is hop bitterness at its finest. As the youngsters would say, that's sweet.

An aggressively hopped IPA brewed with Amarillo and Simcoe hops. Blended Crystal malts balance the flavors with a distinctive spicy aroma and a long, crisp finish."
5317,656,Dundee Festive Ale,11,141,Winter Warmer,6.199999809,"So did you ever ask yourself...what exactly is there to be festive about during the holidays? Your brother in-law snoring on the air mattress? (Boy, let's hope that's snoring.) The variety of toys with realistic sound effects? Fruit cake?

Dundee Festive Ale may be one of the few exceptions. One sip of the carefully matched seasonal spices and you realize that the holidays are worth paying...waiting for.

Oh, there may be one other thing to be festive about. There's a 13 to 1 chance against your brother in-law's plane leaving on time. But at least there's a chance.

Festively hearty and full bodied with a mild nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange peel spice character and subtle crystal malt flavor."
5319,851,Flywheel Bright Lager,8,95,American-Style Lager,5,"The kinetic beauty of spicy hops grabs you by the nose and lets you know: this is German-inspired beer.

A complex hop aroma, with a hint of floral and citrus comes from a combination of Cascades and Liberty hops. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace.

5322,1091,Elissa IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.599999905,"A traditional India Pale Ale, the Elissa IPA is very hoppy with a properly balanced malty body. Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt. Its rich flavor stands up to the hops that would otherwise dominate this beer. The Elissa is an authentic version of an India Pale Ale (IPA) style."
5323,1091,Saint Arnold Spring Bock,7,90,Traditional German-Style Bock,6.400000095,"An authentic, German-style Bock, celebrating the coming of spring.

Saint Arnold Spring Bock is best consumed at 40  Fahrenheit."
5324,692,Jasparilla,1,13,Old Ale,9,"Brilliantly golden, Jasperilla is a unique take on an old ale.

We named this beer after our dog Jasper because he has brought so much joy to our lives. We got Jasper from a local dog rescue group called Mixed Breed Rescue. He has been a constant source of smiles and kept our spirits high through many late nights and long hours at the brewery.

Dark brown in color, fruity and complex with a rich malt backbone. This is a simple yet immensely complex beer meant to be savored and shared with friends and family."
5478,1286,Scratch #19 2009 Imperial Double Expresso Oatmeal Stout,1,21,Oatmeal Stout,9.5,"Every beer tells a story, and some are longer than others.

Consider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.

For Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.

Some stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.

So for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!"
5479,405,Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,5.199999809,"The first offering from the Coastal Extreme Brewing Company blends some of the world's finest ingredients into a delightful beer. In producing our amber ale, we selected the highest quality European and American malts and hops. This ale has a malt character which is delicately balanced with its hop profile so that consumers of all levels enjoy drinking it. Hurricane Amber Ale is a full flavored beer which clearly has more taste than other domestic and imported light beers while at the same time does not overpower the drinker with heavy body or excessive bitterness. So find yourself a cold 'Hurricane' and ENJOY!"
5480,844,Meantime Coffee,2,25,Porter,6,"Whilst we wouldn't recommend having this at breakfast with your bacon and eggs, our Coffee Beer is made with real coffee and has a caffeine hit to match. The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes. 

Our first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwanda's Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.

At the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasn't exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows.

Each serving is equal to one cup of coffee"

We cooked up the straight dope for the growing minions of our nation's Radical Beer junkies. Judges may not be able to define ""Radical Beer,"" but you'll damn well know it when you taste it.

This is not only a BIG beer, it is a Well-Endowed Ale!  We took a traditional English-style Ale and made it our own.  Delightful on its own or as a digestif with a full-bodied cigar, Big Dick's is also big enough to stand up to many boldly-flavored foods."

It finishes with a well-balanced combination of the subtle, almost Pilsner-like maltiness accentuated by the German yeast used to brew this Santa Fe classic, and a hop bite sufficient to leave a lingering smile on the face of any fan of American Pale Ales."
5531,1108,Santa Fe Wheat,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,5.25,"A true Bavarian wheat yeast, sixty percent wheat malt, and German hops make Santa Fe Wheat Beer as true to the style as any American rendition can be. German Wheat Beer, with its hints of banana and clove, its delectable, spicy, hops, and its pale golden color, is becoming increasingly popular in America's craft brewing world, and with good reason: wheat beers are both light enough to please light beer drinkers, and complex enough to please true micro-brew connoisseurs. To mimic a classic German Hefeweisen, after pouring your Santa Fe Wheat Beer into a glass, swirl the last few drops in the bottle to loosen the yeast from the bottom, then pour the yeast over the top of your beer."

The Santa Fe Brewing Company's interpretation of this style uses a combination of high mash temperature, hard water, and low-alpha acid hops to produce a product that is both true to the style and distinctly Santa Fe.

At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city.

Was it divine providence that made this beer the king of the IPA world? Was it a tireless pursuit of glory? No, this IPA has a top-secret recipe to thank for its success, and this meticulously formulated combination of several different hops combined with a very specific brewing process give Fiesta IPA a spicy, citric, and floral infusion of hop character, which is masterfully counterbalanced with the full-bodied maltiness characteristic of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's distinctive beers."
5537,1108,Freestyle Pilsner,7,77,German-Style Pilsener,5.5,"As its name suggests, this Pilsner does not like to be categorized. Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to 'the original' pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hop's pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Company's line up."
5538,1108,Viszolay Belgian,5,60,Belgian-Style Dubbel,7.5,"Viszolay is a distinctly continental ale with a hint of the southwest. Belgian malt, Bavarian and Czech hops, and a secret blend of German and Belgian yeast strains provide this beer, inspired by the Trappist's Dubbel style ale, with a strong traditional base, while a hint of New Mexico wildflower honey infuses it with that ethereal quality that we New Mexicans simply call, 'enchanting'. Like the Trappist ales from which it sprung, Viszolay is light and refreshing. The hop's subtle notes are overpowered by complex fruity flavors derived from the Belgian yeast, leaving Viszolay a very drinkable (yet rather potent) addition to the Santa Fe Brewing Company's family of beers."

Former brewer Ken Pajak teamed up with MSBC to create a very special beer to celebrate the 10 years that he and wife Shauna have owned Cafe Amsterdam. Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a 'beer & wine license' and subsequently transformed the European-style cafe into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. 

The cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right- temperature, glass, presentation. 

'No hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.' 

Gruit is an old style-one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Cafe Amsterdam's Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings.

5551,398,Benchwarmer Porter,2,25,Porter,6.400000095,"""Benchwarmer"" is a very smooth Porter brewed in accordance with the original ""high gravity"" porters of early London. More than 4% chocolate malt, which is the most similar to the brown malts of the early 1700's, gives ""Benchwarmer"" its dry coffee-like finish. It is fermented with the Ringwood yeast which is an excellent yeast for the brewing of porters. The widely accepted theory of how porter got its name is that it was a very popular beer among the porters who hauled produce and goods around the marketplace of early industrialized London."

5553,398,Backyard India Pale Ale,1,2,English-Style India Pale Ale,6.099999905,"""Back Yard"" is a golden India Pale Ale. Historically, ale shipped to India in the 19th Century was brewed to higher gravities so that it could mature during the long sea voyage. English brewers also hopped these ales heavily to protect them from spoiling. The term ""India pale Ale"" or ""I.P.A."" is still used by brewers to denote a super-premium, hoppy pale ale style. Backyard IPA is no exception. English pale barley malt is predominant in this beer with just a small amount of crystal malt. It is well bittered with Cluster and Cascade hops and finished with a mix of local hop and larger amounts of Fuggle hop."

5557,1173,Mokah Imperial Blended Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,11,"When empirical and creative impulses collide, the result is often timeless. The classic utility-art aesthetic of the coffee maker is an example of design and engineering working in concert. 

It is through similar cooperation that the simple bitter cocoa bean is transformed into a sweet treat. As scientists, our brewers utilize their materials to exacting standards. As artists, they couldn't resist the temptation to combine two of our highly acclaimed Blackwater Series Imperial Stouts: Jahva and Choklat. Alone each is perfect, but together as Mokah they are an inimitable expression of two of the world's most sought after flavors. Enjoy Mokah stout with -  or as -  your favorite dessert!

Founded in 1992, the Mart continues to be a catalyst for the San Diego brewing scene, setting the trend for handcrafted ales. Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin is considered some of the most tasty. Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale."
5561,974,Doryman's Dark Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,5.800000191,"Our American Brown Ale has a dark brown color, with a balanced aroma of roasted malts and Northwest-grown hops. The sweetness of the ale and crystal malts blend beautifully with the assertive flavors of Cascade and Mt. Hood hops. A brew to be savored.

This beer originated as a prize-winning homebrew many years ago. When Darron, the Head Brewer, began designing the beers for the Pelican Pub and Brewery, he adapted his old 5 gallon homebrew recipe to his new 15 bbl (465 gallon) brewery. It was well worth the effort, for not only has the Doryman's Dark Ale been a perennial favorite here at the Pelican Pub, but it has garnered prestigious professional awards."

Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit is very versatile and can compliment a number of dishes. This brew pairs well with salads, fish, shrimp and lobster, as long as the dishes are not too spicy. Thai dishes, which often have citric notes in their flavor profile, would also perfectly compliment the orange flavors in Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit."

This fiery red ale is not for the weak at heart. It originally started out as a Scottish red ale but has taken on flavors of its own. This is a very complex recipe using five different grains to achieve its unique flavor. The caramel malt used is a mixture of Belgian Caravienne and Hugh Bairds Crystal malts.

5570,1286,Scratch #20 2009 Apollo Imperial Ale,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,7,"Scratch #20 has been dubbed Apollo Imperial Ale because of our experimentation with a new hop variety.
 
Apollo hops are high alpha acid with an intense aroma. Married with other high alpha hops, with almost two pounds of hops added per barrel produced, AIA has an intense staying power in the back of the throat. After a long discussion between Chris, John and the brewers, they dubbed this hop flavor stinky grapefruit with a hint of perfume. The dark color might lead you to believe the some malt may shine through; but no, the hops are the true player in this ale.
 
Scratch #20 has a dual role, also serving at The Drafting Room's Anniversary Ale for 2009. We brewed a bit more to serve the brewery and The Drafting Room, but get it while when you see it. Before this intense hop flavor subsides, this beer will be sold out."

5618,959,Otter Creek Imperial India Pale Ale,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,11,"Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.
Our Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.

On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports.

4 types of hops are used: Golding, Spalt, Hallertau and Saaz. These hops were fractioned at several times in the cooking process in order to keep a maximum of aroma.

Regarding to taste we can say that the beer has a gentle, but nevertheless bitter aftertaste. Gold-yellow colour. Hoppy aroma."
5647,575,Black Rye Bock,7,90,Traditional German-Style Bock,6.199999809,This dark lager combines the characteristics of three winter beer styles. All three of these styles traditionally come from the colder harsher areas of Europe. The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.
5648,454,Blackened Voodoo,8,95,American-Style Lager,5,"Inspired by old-world brewing methods, this bewitching all-malt brew is a darkly rich, exotic lager, crafted with a touch of magical New Orleans spirit."
5649,1243,Terrapin Midnight Project Depth Charge Espresso Milk Stout,1,20,Sweet Stout,8,"Terrapin Midnight Project Brew Two 2009. Sometime around midnight in a city nobody can agree on, the idea for Terrapin and Left Hand to brew a collaboration beer was born. Depth Charge is the second in the series of one-time releases between the two breweries. Be wary of the calm before the storm. This creamy, deeply delicious milk stout will seduce you into submission while the explosion of hand roasted gourmet espresso will blow you into next week. We Shall Drink in the breweries. We Shall Drink in the pubs, We Shall Drink the the comfort of our homes. We Shall Never Surrender."
5651,54,Red Brick Double Chocolate Oatmeal Porter,2,25,Porter,7.699999809,A robust porter brewed with lots of chocolate malt and roasted barley. This gives the beer its nearly black color and coffee and dark chocolate flavors. These flavors are then tempered with the use of flaked oats which provide an almost creamy texture to the beer. The 7.7% abv is deceptive but is not completely unnoticed.
5655,1160,Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale,11,123,Pumpkin Beer,5.099999905,"Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale is our homage to the craft and heritage of America's brewers. Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and 'pompions.'

In that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original."
5656,858,Big Slick American Barleywine Ale,3,35,American-Style Barley Wine Ale,11.89999962,"This kick ass American Barley Wine is all about hops -Nugget, Chinook, Simcoe and Centennial. And, yeah, LoTs of 'em. OK...there's a substantial malt base on which these juicy Pacific NW hops lie down and do their dirty work. Maybe that's too much info..."
5657,959,Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,10.60000038,"The style was first brewed in England for the Russian Czar and it is the king of stouts. Plenty of big malt flavors- chocolate and roasted- and high alcohol with lower carbonation and mild hops. 
We brewed this beer with double the malts and four times the hops of regular stouts!

Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout clocks in around 10% ABV- a beer to be savored responsibly. True to style, this beer will last for years so you may want to stock up on a few bottles for your cellar while it's available.

Russian Imperial Stouts pair well with creamy cheeses such as camembert (we recommend Vermont-made!), decadent chocolate desserts, or a hearty meal."
5660,171,Abbaye de Saint-Martin Brune,5,66,Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale,8,"Abbaye Saint-Martin Brune was named World's Best Abbey (Dark) Beer @ the 2009 World Beer Awards (London). Aroma of caramel and liquorice.  Less sweet than most traditional Dark Abbey Ales. Many people prefer this double at room temperature. It is especially popular when paired with dessert.
Abbye St. Martin Ales are pure Belgium."
5661,171,Abbaye de Saint-Martin Triple,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,9,"Three varieties of malt and three of hops create the robust character of this St. Martin triple abbey ale.
Abbye St. Martin Ales are pure Belgium."
5662,171,Brasserie de Brunehaut Bio Biere Blanche (Organic),5,67,Belgian-Style White,5,"A classic Belgian 'white beer' from the Hainaut region in the southwest Belgium, near the French border. Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.
Presents a light hazy yellow colour with citrus and coriander aromas and fairly subtle malt and hops on the palate. The finish is dry and satisfying. Hazy yellow golden colour. Lemon custard, lime zest, and delicate spice melange aromas. Well-balanced, a frothy entry leads to a dryish medium body of nuts, baked oranges, and slightly phenolic mineral flavors. Finishes with a metallic ore dust, salt, and dried lemon fade. This beer is certified as organic."
5663,171,Brasserie De Brunehaut Bio Biere Blonde (Organic),5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,6.5,"A classic Belgian blonde ale from the Hainaut region in the southwest Belgium, near the French border. Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.

Caramel malt aromas reminiscent of vanilla, along with toffee, butterscotch and ripe fruits. Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.
Hazy amber to brown coloured beer, with a fluffy off-white head. Nice aroma of spices, yeast and oak.  The alcohol subtle. Flavour is moderately spicy and slightly fruity, with balanced hops. 
This beer is certified organic."
5667,171,Abbaye de St Amand,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,7,"A unique 7% Belgian blonde ale, flavoured with juniper berries. The beer has bittersweet malt flavours, and a heady perfumed aroma of orange and juniper."
5668,1363,Wild Goose Pumpkin Patch,11,123,Pumpkin Beer,6,"Our Fall Seasonal, Pumpkin Patch Ale, is the perfect beer for an autumn night. Pumpkin Patch pours a hazy orange with frothy, ivory colored head. The nose immediately conjures images of Grandma baking pumpkin pie with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger. Medium body and mild carbonation yield a spicy, pumpkin flavor - from the 300 lbs. of pumpkin we use to brew this unique beer."
5671,1062,Rock Art American Red Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,4.800000191,"The unofficial name for this beer is 'Super Glide'. Malty rich with a hint of spicy hops and roasted grains. This beer is one smooth ride with a clean finish! We brewed this one with American Pale, oats, flaked barley, black, chocolate, red malt, melandolin malt. American hops include Magnum, Centennial, Liberty and Crystal. Enjoy!"
5672,1062,The Vermonster,3,35,American-Style Barley Wine Ale,10,We brewed THE VERMONSTER with 110 pounds of malt per barrel and jacked up the pour into a wide mouth thin glass goblet. For an amazing pairing get some Smoked Gouda from Taylor Farm Cheese and a friend!
5673,476,Toaster Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,10,"This beer is an Imperial version of our Black Strap Stout, this time brewed with MORE blackstrap molasses and MORE brown sugar, plus a whole lot more malt and hops too.  Part of our FESTIVAL OF DARKNEss, this one clocks in at over 10%ABV, and is the thickest beer we've ever brewed here."
5674,858,3767 Belgian-style IPA with Brett,5,72,Other Belgian-Style Ales,8,"The extensive distance between two breweries on the West Coast -  3767 miles -  is bridged by this collaboration beer. Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. 

Just prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. 
The plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Here's to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry. Clink!"
5675,858,Cosmic Black Witbier,5,67,Belgian-Style White,6.199999809,"Close your eyes. The delicate aroma, flavor, texture of this beer whisper 'witbier'. Now open your eyes. The color is deceiving. You take another sip. Yes, witbier ... but black as night. It is something quite peculiar-BuT it is brilliant-something shimmering and [not so] white."
5676,44,Michelob Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale,11,141,Winter Warmer,6,"During even the coldest of weather, warm up to the smooth, robust taste of our Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale. Full of rich aromas that you find in the winter months, hints of vanilla and flavorful hops, this is a beer that is great for pouring into a large tulip glass and enjoying with friends around a fireplace."
5677,172,Tournay Black,5,66,Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale,7.599999905,"Tournay Black is a bottle conditioned, Belgian stout brewed by Brasserie de Cazeau which is a farm-brewery located in the south of Belgium.  It was originally brewed as a winter ale under the name Tournay de Noel, but later became a year-round release.  They didn't provide much specific detail about how it was brewed except to say that it is made with water, malts, candi-sugar, hops, and yeast.  It is 7.6% ABV with a recommended drinking temperature of +/- 50 degrees.  The brewer states that the tasting notes are of, ""roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, earth, and cigar ash.""  Well, I am a prodigious cigar smoker and I can't say that I would want to consume the ash."
5680,1160,Big A IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,9.600000381,"Our Big A IPA has earned its share of praise over the last few years. In 2004 the New York Times named it its top IPA , and in 2007 Mens Journal Magazine included it on its list of 25 best beers in America. The last of each year's edition typically leaves our warehouse around mid-May, and, as always, it doesn't last long. 

Stash Wojciechowski, the 'Killer Kielbasa,' created this bonafide India Pale Ale recipe exclusively for the Smuttynose Big Beer Series."
5682,858,Trickster Belgian-style Pumpkin Ale,11,123,Pumpkin Beer,7,"OK, what do you get when we toss pale malted barley, pumpkin and spices into a stainless steel cauldron then stir in some magic? Uh, Trickster! The 'magic' is actually mischievous Belgian yeast at play with cardamom, nutmeg and coriander. This spooky cool brew will make your glass glow bright despite the gloominess of the season. 

Designed to conjure up a little fun during the darkening days of autumn, Trickster is a frivolous concoction of earthy pumpkin, comforting malt, and lively spices. This makes Trickster the brew to accompany your post-winterizing duties, family fall dinners, ghost stories, U-boast-iT stories, and 'supposedly haunted' garage parties. 

But the flavor range of Trickster also pairs well with citrusy and spicy cuisine. Try a glowing glass with your favorite dishes that incorporate nutmeg, cardamom or coriander-like Thai curries, Swedish meatballs, gingerbread, roasted pumpkin soup. Add Trickster to soups and sauces, batters and doughs, glasses and mugs."
5683,858,Berserker Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,12.69999981,"Vicious and viscous, this menacing brew pours opaque black with a creamy maduro-colored head. Its aroma offers seductive whiskey, chewy red wine, dark fruit and lavish tobacco. Berserker Imperial Stout invades your taste buds with in-your-face flavor. Weighing in at almost 13% alcohol by volume, Berserker is completely out-of-control. Give it a good fight.

This version of Berserker Imperial Stout was aged in both red wine and whiskey barrels. The entire batch was brought back together before being packaged in kegs and 22-oz bottles."
5684,1204,Imperial Russian Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,10.5,"Brewed in the authentic historical style of an Imperial Russian Stout, this ale is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, lack currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can --- and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!"
5685,812,Howl,8,95,American-Style Lager,4.599999905,"Born of dark and cold and snow in the marrow of the northeast's longest night, HOWL comes in on wailing winds with winter-weary eyes burning holes in sunless shadows. In its darkened depths out inner voids are warmed."
5686,1062,Whitetail Golden Ale,3,37,Golden or Blonde Ale,5,"Our golden American ale has a crisp body and slightly dry, hoppy finish. This is a real treat for the beer lover. Pale, wheat and torrified wheat malts are used with Northern Brewer and Mt. Hood hops."
5687,62,DuganA IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,8.5,"Lupulin Rapture Incarnate! As fervent  devotees of hops, we found ourselves on a quest to create a transcendental IPA capable of quenching our voracious lupulin desires. Our mantra became ""unity of bitterness, hop flavor and aroma."" Enlightened, duganA IPA was born: A brutally bitter, dank, piney and resinous ale designed for those seeking a divine hop experience."
5688,1352,Golf,4,50,South German-Style Hefeweizen,5,"A Brewer's Select Series, Golf is a fest-weisse hybrid or 'Festeweizen.' It will weigh in at 5.0% and is made with Munich, Wheat, and CaraVienna malts and Spalt hops."
5689,1035,Old Salt IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,5.800000191,Our India Pale Ale is hoppy and bitter with a nice sweet malt finish. Slow dry-hop conditioning brings out the herbal hop aromas.
5690,1035,Cascade Razberry Wheat,11,121,Fruit Beer,4.5,Razberry Wheat is crisp with a refreshing tartness and the fresh aroma of raspberries. This salmon pink ale is just the thing to transport you to berry time in the summer.
5691,1035,Celtic Copper Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,5.199999809,Celtic Copper is a mahogany hued ale with rich malt flavor and subtle hop balance; an excellent choice for those who prefer amber ales.
5692,1035,Ring Tail Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,4.199999809,"Ring Tail Pale is light in body and straw-gold in color, with a crisp hop finish. This beer is a great choice for domestic lager drinkers."
5693,1035,Bad Billy Blond Bock,7,91,German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock,6.199999809,Our Blond Bock is gold in color and features a malty profile and a spicy finish courtesy of Saaz hops. This beer boasts the flavor of a traditional Bock without the cloying aftertaste.
5694,1035,Cascade Apricot Ale,5,70,Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic,9,"Features the intense aroma of fresh-picked, slow ripened Northwest apricots warmed by the summer sun. Based on a Belgian Tripel, this beer went through 16 months lactic fermentation and aging in French oak wine barrels."
5698,541,Exit 11 - Hoppy American Wheat,11,116,Light American Wheat Ale or Lager,6.199999809,"Exit 11 Hoppy American Wheat Ale is the second in their wildly popular Exit Series of Big Bottle Beers. Exit 11 is a confluence of styles and ingredients, just as Exit 11 is the point in New Jersey where the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and several other highways come together.

'Exit 11 is the point on the Turnpike where the Garden State Parkway branches off and takes hundreds of thousands of travelers to the renowned Jersey Shore,' says Flying Fish Founder Gene Muller.  'Our Exit 11 Wheat Ale is a fresh, citrus-y summer beer perfect for beachgoers and those who only wish they were headed 'downa shore'.'

Exit 11 is an American-style wheat beer brewed with English ale yeast and three Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus, Palisade and Amarillo.  It is brewed with 50% Belgian pale malt and 50% white wheat, and is an ideal summer thirst quencher, with its bouquet of tangerines and apricots. Exit 11 is available only during this one-time release, and only until it sells out across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware."

5700,57,Grain Belt,8,95,American-Style Lager,4.599999905,"This beer has changed hands a bit over its 60+ year history - first brewed by the Grain Belt Brewery in Minneapolis, then by the now-defunct Minnesota Brewing and currently by August Schell Brewing Co. in New Ulm."
5701,1286,Scratch #25 2009 Magical Moustache Rye,11,119,American Rye Ale or Lager,6.5,"This mahogany ale packs a lingering, earthy hoppiness. The addition of more than 20% rye to the grain bill gives a creamy mouthfeel and hints of spice that compliment the bitterness of hops. Subtle fruitiness come through from the Bravo hops added during the boil, but the Cluster and Liberty varieties used in dry-hopping this beer are the true flavor drivers in this spicy ale. Dark in color and intense is flavor, Scratch 25-2009 finds true balance in a beer that could have easily gone way over the top. Enjoy."
5702,241,Punk IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6,"This 6% trans-atlantic fusion IPA is light golden in colour with tropical fruits and light caramel on the nose. The palate soon becomes assertive and resinous with the New Zealand hops balanced by the biscuit malt. The finish is aggressive and dry with the hops emerging over the warming alcohol.

This fresh, full flavour natural beer is our tribute to the classic IPAs of yester-year. The post modern twist is the addition of amazing fruity hops giving an explosion of tropical fruit flavours and a sharp bitter finish."
5703,241,Rip Tide,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,8,"A strong, silky smooth imperial stout with a deep, dark ruby appearance. Mocha, bitter chocolate, liquorice and dark cherry flavours prevail, before the balanced, warming and encapsulating finish.

A contemporary Scottish take on an age old Russian classic style originally brewed for the Tsars. Our interpretation brings together hops from both sides of the Atlantic, amazing flavoured malts and dark sugars.

Like the original BrewDog, this beer would never bite you but would much rather give you a lick on the face. Look Out!

Serving Suggestion: Enjoy with an air of aristocratic nonchalance"
5707,241,Hardcore IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,9,"This little bottle has a grandiloquent story to tell.

2,204 malted Maris Otter grains gave all they had to offer the world to provide the robustly delicate toffee malt canvas for the ensuing epic.

6 Hop Cones willingly sacrificed themselves in fiery cauldron that is our brew kettle to ensure your mouth is left feeling punished and puckering for more.

9,900,000,000 yeast cells frantically fermented their little hearts out as the sugars were magically turned into alcohol in the dark depths of our fermentation tanks.

This explicit ale has more hops and bitterness that any other beer brewed in the UK. This is an extreme beer rollercoaster for freaks, gypsies and international chess superstars."
5708,241,Trashy Blonde,1,4,Special Bitter or Best Bitter,4.099999905,"A titillating, neurotic, peroxide, punk of a pale ale. Combining attitude, style substance and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say?

You really should just leave it alone...

...but you just cant get the compulsive malt body and gorgeous dirty blonde colour out of your head. The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached.

All wrapped up with the customary Brewdog bite and imaginative twist. This trashy blonde is going to get you into a lot of trouble."
5709,241,77 Lager,7,77,German-Style Pilsener,4.900000095,"A Lager that actually tastes of something?

You have to be kidding, right?

77 lager is made with 100% malt and whole leaf hops.

It contains no preservatives, additives, cheap substitutes or any other junk.

Maybe we are crazy. So what?

Taste 77 Lager and we are pretty sure you will agree that the fine line between genius and insanity has just become a little more blurred."
5710,241,Dogma,11,126,Herb and Spice Beer,7.800000191,"Dogma is an innovative, enigmatic ale brewed with guarana, poppy seeds and kola nut all blended together with Scottish heather honey. A conspiracy of transcontinental ingredients infused with some devastatingly BrewDog imaginative thinking.

The flavours, intricacies and nuances of this beer are best enjoyed while musing over some obscure 17th Century philosophical meanderings, such as:

""If we disbelieve everything because we cannot certainly know all things we will do much, what as wisely as he who would not use his wings but sit still and perish because he had no wings to fly.""
John Locke.

This beer is not cool. You may think it is, but that is just a beautiful lie fabricated by clowns and gypsies."
5711,241,Tokyo,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,12,"The irony of existentialism, the parody of being and the inherent contradictions of post-modernism, all so delicately conveyed by the blocky, pixelated arcade action have all been painstakingly recreated in this bottles contents.

This imperial stout is brewed with copious amounts of speciality malts, jasmine and cranberries. After fermentation we then dry-hop this killer stout with a bucketload of our favourite hops before carefully ageing the beer on French toasted oak chips.

It is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times."
5713,241,Tactical Nuclear Penguin,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,32,"This is the worlds strongest ever beer, ever (yes ever).

No Penguins  were harmed in the making of this beer; some humans did get very, very cold though. It was worth it.

The Antarctic name, inducing schizophrenia, of this Yber-imperial stout originates from the amount of time it spent exposed to extreme cold. This beer was initially double barrel aged for 14 months; maturing in the deep, rich oak of Scottish whisky casks. After this epic maturation the beer was then frozen, then frozen again, then frozen again.

This is an extremely strong beer, it should be enjoyed in small servings and with an air of aristocratic nonchalance. In exactly the same manner that you would enjoy a fine whisky, a Frank Zappa album or a visit from a friendly yet anxious ghost."
5714,1243,Hopsecutioner,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,7.199999809,"Here ye, here ye...All hopheads shall herewith rejoice! Terrapin has recruited ye old HOPSECUTIONER to execute the exact hop profile for this killer IPA!"
5715,1243,Terrapin Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,8.600000381,"Black as night, this coffee stout is thick, rich and full of real coffee flavor. Brewed with the Terrapin Wake-n-Bake coffee blend created by Terrapin & Jittery Joe's Coffee."
5717,1286,Troegs Splinter Beer Red,3,30,American-Style Strong Pale Ale,11,"Before filtering the final batch of 2008 Mad Elf we racked some beer into bourbon barrels for six weeks of tender loving care. After bottling, we aged the beer for approximately eight months. This allows the tart cherries to push to the front. Subtle vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, coconut and toasted nut endnotes emanate from Splinter Red."
5718,1286,Troegs Splinter Beer Gold,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,12,"The transformation of Scratch #3-2007 to Splinter Gold has been a slow rest in oak wine barrels dosed with brettanomyces. During a two-year aging period the horsy flavors of the brett combined with the Westmalle yeast used during primary fermentation to create a complex blend of flavors. Bone-dry and 12% abv, Splinter Gold is highly carbonated."
5721,1220,Horizon Red Ale,3,33,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,5.699999809,"A richer shade of Red. Summit has artfully crossed the boundaries of traditional IPA and Amber styles to create a brew all our own. Featuring an aromatic blend of Horizon, Amarillo and Cascade hops with nicely balanced malts for a flavor you'll enjoy to the fullest."
5722,259,Winter Ale,11,141,Winter Warmer,0,A seasonal winter beer from Brooklyn
5723,1203,Stateside Saison,5,74,French & Belgian-Style Saison,0,"An 'American Farmhouse Ale.' It's a Belgian-inspired brew that uses a combination of European malts, hops from New New Zealand and the United States.. and a classic farmhouse yeast to achieve a fruity, yet spicy, melange of flavors and aroma."
5724,379,Jai Alai IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,7.5,"Jai Alai IPA is a monster interpretation of an American IPA. In fact, it is so big that it equals the alcohol of some double IPAs on the market. Our IPA uses 6 different hop varietals, with Simcoe hops only being used for dry hopping. The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency. Ultimately, Jai Alai is a very strong interpretation of a single American IPA. We hope that it makes Tampa Bay natives happy because this is head brewer Wayne Wamble's favorite Cigar City beer and he'd love to share one with you!"
5725,379,Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,5.5,"Maduro is a Northern English-style brown ale with some American affectations. It is unlike the typical American Brown Ale, as it doesn't have the big hop character common in American-brewed Brown Ales. And Maduro is higher in alcohol than the common English brown ale. Maduro also has oats, in the malt bill which imparts a silky body and aids in making the roasted, toasted and chocolate components mesh together in Maduro's complex malt profile. The end result is a remarkably full flavored yet approachable and sessionable brown ale that pairs well with cigars."
5726,379,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,11,"This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Gregory Zhukov. Arguably one of World War II's finest generals and a man bold enough to appreciate the rich, complex flavors of a beer brewed to fortify a body through the Russian winter. Like military geniuses, Russian Imperial Stouts reach their peak with a little age on them, so we release Marshal Zhukov's Russian Imperial Stout in sweltering August so that it will be at peak flavor come January or February.

Opaque black in color, the aroma has notes of espresso, chocolate, dark sweet toffee with hints of black strap molasses. The flavor starts with an unsweetened chocolate character and supporting notes of herbal dryness from English hop varietals. It then moves into dark toffee sweetness and closes with a slap of roasty espresso. Zhukov's Imperial Stout pairs well with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.  Enjoy, comrade."
5727,379,Guava Grove Ale,5,74,French & Belgian-Style Saison,8,Guava Grove is a Saison which is fermented with guava. The guava adds sweetness and acidity to the prodigious fruity esters imparted by the warm fermentation temperatures  of the Belgian yeast strain.
5728,379,Big Sound Scotch Ale,1,15,Scotch Ale,8.5,"Big Sound Scotch Ale is dedicated to our good buddy Gino, the most punk rock bagpiper you'll ever meet, and the rest of the men and women of Tampa Bay Pipes and Drums. Brown in color, Big Sound has huge notes of dark sweet toffee with underlying mild notes of coffee in the aroma. The flavor starts with a slight note of cherry and then opens into a Goliath of a malt character with notes of dark sweet toffee, slight hints of coffee and mild notes of toasted bread in the finish. Big Sound Scotch Ale pairs well with Haggis, Highland Games, Huge Heads and Enormous Pillows and of course Bagpipe music."
5730,718,JoBoy's IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.5,"This is our offering to the hop heads! A decidedly hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong American IPA. We use a generous amount of whole leaf Cascade, Centennial and Citra hops to showcase the freshness and earthy flavors that only hops can provide."
5731,718,Manheim Stout,3,42,American-Style Stout,0,"An intense and rich, dark, roasty ale with substantial alcohol warming. Requires several months of aging."
5732,718,JoBoy's Cream Ale,11,113,American-Style Cream Ale or Lager,0,"A crisp, clean, easy drinking, refreshing American ale with a light body."
5733,1091,Divine Reserve 9,3,43,American-Style Imperial Stout,11,"Important: let this beer warm to at least 50  before enjoying.  This beer is black with some ruby highlights.  The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol.  There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla.  The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.  As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish.  The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.  The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter."
5734,1044,Phoenixx Double ESB,1,5,Extra Special Bitter,7.199999809,"Our winter seasonal is inspired by the great ales of the UK but brewed with a distinctively American attitude. English crystal malt gives Phoenixx its subtle toffee and caramel notes, but this ale is about hops. The blend of English hops, highlighted by its namesake, Phoenix, yields a complex hop character that dominates this special brew."
5735,1,(512) Wit,5,67,Belgian-Style White,5.199999809,"Made in the style of the Belgian wheat beers that are so refreshing, (512) Wit is a hazy ale spiced with coriander and domestic grapefruit peel. 50% US Organic 2-row malted barley and 50% US unmalted wheat and oats make this a light, crisp ale well suited for any occasion."
5736,1,(512) Pale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5.800000191,"With Organic 2-row malted barley, (512) Pale is a copper colored American Pale Ale that balances earthy hop bitterness and hop flavor with a rich malty body."
5737,1,(512) IPA,3,31,American-Style India Pale Ale,7,"(512) India Pale Ale is a big, aggressively dry-hopped American IPA with smooth bitterness (~65 IBU) balanced by medium maltiness. Organic 2-row malted barley, loads of hops, and great Austin water create an ale with apricot and vanilla aromatics that lure you in for more."
5738,1,(512) Pecan Porter,2,25,Porter,6.800000191,"Nearly black in color, (512) Pecan Porter is made with Organic US 2-row and Crystal malts along with Baird's Chocolate and Black malts. Its full body and malty sweetness are balanced with subtle pecan aroma and flavor from locally grown pecans. Yet another true Austin original!"
5739,1,(512) ALT,4,57,German-Style Brown Ale/Altbier,6,"(512) ALT is a German-style amber ale that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager. ALT means 'old' in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone and a characteristic German yeast character. Made with 98% Organic 2-row and Munch malts and US noble hops."
5740,1,(512) Bruin,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,7.599999905,"At once cuddly and ferocious, (512) BRUIN combines a smooth, rich maltiness and mahogany color with a solid hop backbone and stealthy 7.6% alcohol. Made with Organic 2 Row and Munich malts, plus Chocolate and Crystal malts, domestic hops, and a touch of molasses, this brew has notes of raisins, dark sugars, and cocoa, and pairs perfectly with food and the crisp fall air."
5741,1,(512) Whiskey Barrel Aged Double Pecan Porter,2,25,Porter,8.199999809,"Our first barrel project is in kegs and on it's way to beer bars around Austin. This is a bigger, bolder version of our mainstay Pecan Porter, with a richer finish. Two months on recently emptied Jack Daniels select barrels imparted a wonderful vanilla character from the oak and a pleasant amount of whiskey nose and flavor. All in all, I'm really proud of the hard work and effort put into this beer. Our first attempt at brewing it and our first attempt at managing barrels has paid off for everyone! Seek out this beer, but don't put it off. There is a very limited number of kegs available and it might go fast..."

5744,1286,Scratch #27 2010 Cocaoabunga,3,42,American-Style Stout,6.699999809,"Scratch #27-2010 begins a new fold in the Scratch series. For the next several batches individual Troegs brewers will create recipes of their choice. First up, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer.

This collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.

Dubbed Cocaoabunga, this unfiltered beer has a pleasant cocoa aroma, a subtle sweetness in the mouthfeel, a full-bodied flavor, and hints of vanilla. Enjoy!"
5745,341,Captin Lawrence Pale Ale,3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,5.599999905,"One of the first beers I brewed after moving out to California to begin my brewing education was a Pale Ale. This version is a true testament to the influences the Wild West had on my early brewing. My Pale Ale is loaded with US-grown Cascade, Crystal, and Columbus hops, so be sure to take a good sniff to enjoy their robust aromas before taking your first sip."
5746,341,Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,10,"This beer is the result of the marriage between two very distinct beer styles; the Belgian Tripel & American IPA. We have taken the best qualities from both styles and allowed them to shine through. The fruity and spicy notes from the imported Belgian yeast strain & the pungent flavors and aromas of the American grown Amarillo hops flow seamlessly together to create this flavorful ale.  Straight from the Captain's cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy."
5747,341,Captin Lawrence Liquid Gold,5,64,Belgian-Style Pale Ale,6,"Don't let the golden color fool you - this isn't your father's lite beer!

5748,341,Captin Lawrence Smoked Porter,2,25,Porter,6.400000095,"A complex beer, with layers of flavors unfolding as this beer slides down your throat. Before the introduction of indirect-fired malt kilns, all beers had a smoky flavor. Today only a handful of brewers produce beer reminiscent of those of the past. We use imported German smoked malt to add depth and complexity to our Smoked Porter."
5749,341,Captain's Reserve Imperial IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,9,"This beer is a salute to the ingenuity and creativity of the American craft brewers. A uniquely American style of beer, the Double or Imperial IPA, has become the calling card of many craft brewers who aren't afraid to push the limits of what hops can add to a beer. This beer is big and hoppy - not for the faint of heart! Be prepared to experience sensory overload as you savor this Imperial IPA."
5750,341,Sun Block - Belgian Style Witte,5,67,Belgian-Style White,0,"This beer was created as a summer thirst quencher, because we all know how hot and humid it can get in New York during the summer. We brewed this beer using both coriander and orange peel in the boil to increase both the aroma and flavor of this beer. Make sure you don't get burned this summer, drink your Sun Block."
5751,341,Brown Bird Brown Ale,3,38,American-Style Brown Ale,4.800000191,"Named after the little birds that fly by the brewery looking for grain after the weather turns cold, this was originally to be a Fall/Winter seasonal. Clearly we underestimated the market for this smooth and malty brown ale, and we have decided to keep it for year round enjoyment."
5752,341,Nor' Easter,5,66,Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale,12,"This is a truly unique brew, combining some unusual elements to create a powerful, yet flavorful brew. I brewed a similar beer to this one back in 1998, while I was home brewing out in California. Only this time around I decided to age it in bourbon barrels to add a new element to the already rich sensory profile. The combination of dark malt, elderberries and bourbon barrels makes for an interesting tasting experience. This is a sippin' beer, so sit back by the fire and enjoy. 12% alcohol by volume."
5753,341,Golden Delicious,5,61,Belgian-Style Tripel,0,"There's nothing quite likes Mom's apple pie...But I am willing to bet this beer is pretty darn close.  An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this country's oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captain's cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy."

Abundant American hops offer grapefruit, pine, must and mint, which play off the fullness and sweetness of pale malts then provide a biting yet enticing finish.

Mayhem Double IPA accents the complex spice combinations found in Thai, Indian, Cajun, Morrocan, Mexican and Southwest American cuisines as well as BBQ marinades, dry rubs and sauces.

Mayhem creates MAYHEM."
5759,858,RUMBAH Double Rum Bock,7,92,German-Style Doppelbock,10,"Beer Description:
This double bock provides smooth sailin' in rough seas. The fact that this luscious lager was aged in rum barrels creates the illusion that the open sea is a safe place. And while riding out these waves of grain, you may fall victim to the dangers of pirates, rum, bock. OK...maybe the beach is a bit over-rated."
5760,858,Bathtub Gin Gruit Ale,11,126,Herb and Spice Beer,8,"This gruit ale was inspired by the Phish song of the same name. A traditional gruit in style, Bathtub Gin was brewed without hops. Instead Ben spiced his beer with botanicals typically used to flavor gin: juniper berries, orris root, angelica root, grains of paradise, lemon peel, orange peel and coriander. The result is intensely fragrant, flavorful and fabulous."
5761,1173,Farmer's Tan Imperial Pale Lager,8,95,American-Style Lager,9,"Neolithic humans evolved from nomadic hunters into a more settled agricultural society, changing life forever. The 'founder' crops they raised included wheat and barley. It is little surprise that the first examples of brewing appeared during this age.

Brewers owe much to the epoch. Similarly, we thank our farmer friends of today for cultivating the ingredients the are responsible for the beers we now enjoy. Their laborious days spent ourdoors under the hot sun earn them respect, as well as a mark of distinction: the farmer's tan. Yes, the inevitable red and white hallmark of hard work."

5765,634,Glacier Harvest '09 Wet Hop (100 Barrel Series #28),3,26,American-Style Pale Ale,6.699999809,"For the 28th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, we're celebrating this year's hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.
 
Wet hop beers are brewed using fresh, 'wet' hops instead of traditional dried hops-hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.

Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.
This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.

Harpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested 'wet' hops."
5766,44,Michelob Irish Red,2,22,Irish-Style Red Ale,0,"Born of Irish tradition, this all-malt ale uses kilned and toasted malts to produce its all-natural, signature red shade. A beer with exceptional balance, Irish Red displays an initial sweetness that fades to a clean, dry finish."

5768,1172,Buried Hatchet Stout,3,42,American-Style Stout,8.25,"Jet-black in color, this monster smells of coffee and chocolate.  The taste is much of the same, with hints of creamy toffee and roasted malt.  Smooth and delicious, this medium bodied ale is all about the malts, but has enough hop bitterness to be balanced."
5769,202,Vigneronne,5,70,Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic,5,"The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987. This name reminds us that, while it belongs to the beer patrimony, the spontaneous fermentation, the ageing in the barrels for several years and the addition of grapes make it a distant cousin of certain white wines.

In spite of its success, the Vigneronne represents less than 5% of the total production of the Cantillon brewery. In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October."
5770,541,Exit 16 - Wild Rice Double IPA,3,32,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,8.199999809,"The fourth stop on our multi-year trip to explore New Jersey takes us to one of the most maligned places in the state- the Hackensack Meadowlands. It's the place usually identified with landfills, pipelines, mob burials (alleged) and sports teams that say they're from New York.

Although no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, we've brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.

Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops we've added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine."

I love it, LoVe it, LOVE it.] The first batch of red IPA was mashed, sparged, and transferred to the kettle. The second batch of red IPA was mashed, sparged and transferred to the kettle using the sweet wort from batch one as its mash ""water"". Hmmm...using ""beer"" to make beer.

This India Pale Ale is unabashedly hoppy, not only from the Amarillo hops we add to the brew kettle, but also from the northwest U.S. variety called Cascade that we add directly to the final tank. A firm toasted malt presence forms the background for all of these hops, and we're confident our Little Scrapper IPA could take other so-called IPA's to the mat if called upon to do so.
